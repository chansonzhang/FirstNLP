Japanese,"What you can do for your health and I like it Hi ! Long time no see friend ><; Although lately I have not written my entry, from now on, I will try to write my entry everyday again! First of all, you can do a running or a little more speedy walking for your health after working or attending school even for a few minutes sometimes in a week. Another things in order for you to keep healty are to cut over-eating in every diet. What's more , the most important thing for you is to prepare yourself becoming sick or having a bad disease before. This attempt of mind will make you change to a thought about your health. The most keen i want to tell you at this moment, therefore, is this that , at any time, you should keep on having a mind that your health is made by you, not innate.

Japanese,"Essay 11: Which should schools emphasis more, competition or cooperation? We need to spark studentsâ€™ interest in each subject rather than compare with each other in the first place. We tend to be good at those which we like. Students will get more involved in learning when they find out what they really like. Competition can improve academic ability to some degree, but it has limitations. To compare with someone might make student lose confidence and even hate studying. On the other hand, students will be able to lift their self-esteem when they work hard for their own goal by cooperating. It was fun for me to solve questions arguing with my friends in my school days. Those memories last long and so does knowledge. At school they should pay more attention to foster a love of learning and nurture self-control."

The green celery and peanuts was served for opening. When my wife saw it, she said this celery seemed too green. Until I heard her, I had not thought such an idea. But, for me, though I might hear her feeling, it begins to seem too green. She said, â€œThere must be some treatment to make celery too green. I do not like this.â€ So, we became a little nervous for the starter. Anyway, dished are delicious. I could have known Shanghaiâ€™s dishes are not hot and simple, but tasty."

Japanese,"For the next TOEIC Ever since one of my goals, which I got over 800 on the TOEIC test, was achieved, I've not taken the test and focused on my work or daily routine study of English. However, I think I'll take it next year. In fact, I was supposed to take it this year, but I didn't managed to do because I was up to my neck in my lessons, training lessons for teachers and advertisement for my class room etc. Last time, I didn't consider my plans to take the test, but I'll be apparently required to study for it because I'm shooting for around 900. It's said some of questions are so tricky that those who want to make a high score should find their weak points and review them in detail or English grammar. They should not only review, but they're also better off getting the knack of answering the questions within a time limit. I'm not good at dissect my last score or weak points, nor think up I the best tactics. But I'll make all-out efforts... These kinds of efforts might lead to beef up my overall English ability. :D Anyway, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, everyone!!"

Japanese,"On Yomi and Kun Yomi éŸ³On is the Chinese ways of reading for the Kanji and è¨“ Kun is Japanese ways of reading for it. On means sound. Kun means knowing something. Kunwa (è¨“è©±) A story to know something good. ç¤¾é•·è¨“è©± President Speech Kanji mean Han Dynastyâ€™s letters 206BC â€“ 220AD, irrespective of when they were created in China and when imported from China to Japan. Japan dispatched students to China each era when China flourished where Chinese culture flourished. They brought Kanji back with their pronunciations of times and of places, of course philosophies of them were main purposes. There are three main éŸ³On as an example è¡Œ:ãŠã“ãªã†ãƒ»ã‚†ãï¼ˆKunï¼‰ Go On ï¼ˆå‘‰éŸ³ï¼‰is pronunciation in 400AD -600AD è¡Œæ”¿ã€€ãŽã‚‡ã†ãƒ»ã›ã„ Administration Kan On ï¼ˆæ¼¢éŸ³ï¼‰is pronunciation in 600AD â€“ 800AD è¡Œç‚º ã“ã†ãƒ»ã„ Action Tou On ï¼ˆå”éŸ³ï¼‰is pronunciation in 1200AD â€“ 1400AD è¡Œè„š ã‚ã‚“ãƒ»ãŽã‚ƒã€€Travelling around for Buddhism Purpose å”(Tang) is not related to Tang Dynasty 600AD - 900D itself directly. å” means just China. å‘‰andæ¼¢ are also the same.

Chinese letters are like pictures. If you draw HEAD, this picture or letter means head. If you show it to a German, he would understand that it is head, but he would pronounce it as Kopf. Chinese in Japanese is like Latin or French in English. Buy is Kun Yomi and Procure is On Yomi."

They did so mostly because of their parents' overseas assignments. They can speak both Japanese and English very fluently without any effort since these languages are their native languages.

This summer, in Japan,we are trying not to use much energy. As you know,Japan had been struck by very big earthquake in March, and the big problem happened at Fukushima energy plant.

The prefecture where I live has the most nuclear power plants and some of them doesn't work now. This is very difficult problem for us. Certainly,it is very dengerous, but it may be difficult to stop working them right away because Japan rely on nuclear power for many part of electric suply. However,We must decide whether we use nuclear power plant in future. I think it is our generations who decide it. So younger peopole in Japan should have more interest in these problem or politics. What do you think about a nucler poower plant? Please let me your opinion."

Japanese,"Alt guide of Japan 30 faux pas 6 Again, Japan`s turn. I`ve heard many times that the Japanese language(NipponGo æ—¥æœ¬èªž) is a vague language from the Westerner`s point of view. I don`t know the truth of it, because I really don`t know other of this planet`s languages, I only know a little English. A science-like topic said that NipponGo is a synthetic language, of course the great English is analytic language... I don`t understand what the topic said, I simply got the impression that NipponGo was inferior than what they spoke. Is there any rational reason that many western people have such an impression about NipponGo? In my opinion, the Japanese language has an unfamilar face to Westerners, because of Kanji characters. ""A"" is a just single sign in the alphabet. The four characters of W,O,R and D makes ""word"" in English. This looks simple. Only 26 characters produce all English words. On the other hand, Hiragana, Katakana and RomaJi(roman letters spelling) are all signs like an alphabet. However, most Kanji are not simple signs but symbols. Therefore, regular Kana and Kanji mixed in the Japanese that we commonly write and speak, which is (in a sense) similar to building construction by assembling many symbolic parts. Nippon or Nihon is just a name of some nation that also known as Japan. But, as for æ—¥æœ¬, two Kanji character each has it`s own symbolic meaning of, æ—¥, the Sun. æœ¬, base, genuine, essence and book. So, the combined word æ—¥æœ¬ has a meaning of "" The place where the Sun rises"". So, if I say so myself, ""Japan"" is not equal to ""æ—¥æœ¬â€ for Japanese people. Every country can see the sunrise, Of course. This was the reason why our ancestor named Nihon to this islands. ç¶šã"

Japanese,"We need English as official language? Recently two Japanese companies, UNIQLO and Rakuten, decided to change their official language from Japanese to English. They plan to expand their business overseas. They think if they continue to use Japanese as official language, they can't employ overseas people that can't speak Japanese but have excellent skills. Furthermore, Rakuten intends to sack the corporate officers if they will not learn English until two years later. The employees that can't use English also will be reduced. I heard that now they use English at meetings even though all attendees are Japanese. Some Japanese bloggers say that it's the excellent decision because Japanese employees will be able to communicate with overseas employees and customers more easily than before if they will learn English. Usually overseas people can understand English even if they're not from English-speaking countries. On the other hands, there are people that criticize it. Some of them say that not all employees need to use English. Even the employees that have high English skills can't convey detailed intentions in English as well as in Japanese. Japanese employee will not be able to communicate well each other. It will bring adverse effect. I totally agree an opinion that English is important for communication. I work only in Japan, but sometimes I need to use English. It is necessary for me, and much more for people that work at global companies. However, I wonder that they really need to change the official language while going out of their way to sack or reduce employees and to talk in English among Japanese employees. How do you think about it?"

Actually I wanted to go out and exercise, but it was cold outside and I have allergy to pollen, so I spent my time inside. Today, I got up late in the morning because I stayed up late at night yesterday. After breakfast, I started reading Twisted, which is a mystery novel in English. It is a collection of 12 short stories, and I finished reading first story and the middle of second one. The author is Jeffery Deaver, which is probably popular because I found this book in the top seller ranking of Amazon. Itâ€™s not so difficult that I recommend you to read it.

Japanese,"Asahiyama zoo We visited Asahiyama zoo in Asahikawa City, Hokkaido. Asahiyama zoo is the most famous zoo for its unique facilities in Japan, but itâ€™s not unique, but rather natural for animals. That zooâ€™s stuff arranged cages and aquariums to show animal life in a more natural environment. So we can enjoy the animals' natural behavior and habits with interest much more than the others. I thought that why the zoo is called â€œAsahiyamaâ€, not â€œAsahikawaâ€? Now I knew, it is located at Asahiyama Mountain, so we walked up and down looking animals. After enjoying the zoo, we drove to Ueno Farm with an English-style garden that has been adapted to a ""Hokkaido Garden"" to match the climate and soil conditions in Hokkaido.

EMC stands for Electromagnetic Compatibility. Sounds difficult, doesnâ€™t it? I still donâ€™t understand everything. Anyway, today I would like you to correct the work Iâ€™ve done before. It might be difficult if you donâ€™t know about the electricity. Sorry! Inductance:ã€€Property of a circuit to oppose a change in current. The moving magnetic field produced by a change in current causes an induced voltage to oppose the original change. A magnetic field is generated when flowing DC to a spirally-coiled conductor. In a moment of the magnetic field formed, the back electro-motive force would be induced in the coil. This phenomenon is called a self-induction-effect. The ratio of this reverse direction voltage is called â€œInductanceâ€."

Japanese,"Do the world's wildness should be better protected? I tried to write two essays. I have learned some pattern of essay writings and at the same time I realized I won't write better essay without practice. ********************** Today, we often hear that we should save the world's wildness. I totally agree this idea. Can we protect the world's wildness? I don't think so. First of all, population growth has gratly influenced on the world. We have expanded land since early times but the larger population growth becomes, the more we need to get new land. As a result of this, wildness is decreasing. Futhermore, ecotourism, whose business takes advantage of wildness, may have harmful effects on wildness. People want to enjoy and learn wildness but, ironically, it may damage on the environment. Some people argue ecotourism helps the local people develop economy, but one of the problems is that they may focus too much on their business and they may pay little attention to protect wildness. We tend to pursue our profit, but we should consider future generations. Saving the world's wildness will lead to saving our future generations."
Japanese,"Talking about a cram shool in Japan. I'm going to talking about education in Japan. Some people in Japan think it's really important to send their children to competitive Kindergartens. So some Japanese children have to go to a cram school. This topic may be a little hard for me. But I wonder that I write down my opinions. ***** I had taken examinations apply to junior high schools and colleges. They were valuable experiences for me. I don't think the examination ordeal is so bad. Because students try to find out efficient ways which they study something with. When they will grow up, it will be useful for their work. By the way, I heard my friend's daughter has attended to a public junior high school. She said she doesn't like her school, though she liked her elementary school. Their surroundings may be bad. It may be important to chose a school. But educations cost a lot of money in Japan, for a private school ,a crammer and so on. I think it is serious problem. I hope that some public schools' qualities are inproved better."

Or something invisible such us love, peace, friendshipâ€¦. a sort of special collection such as old stamps or plastic model trains? It depends on each person. A common thing is that we never realize its importance untie we lose it. It is a key. Yet, it is was a key that I lost and found recently. Ladies and gentlemen, this is my 5 hours episode that I lost and found the key of my entrance door. It happened on Sunday 2 weeks ago. ï¼‘ï¼—ï¼šï¼ï¼ I was planning to have a dinner in my friendâ€™s house. I prepared special recipe of miso based milk tasted nabe.

At the entrance, there is a shelf with 2 drawlers which height is around my waist it locates by the wall. I usually put the entrance key on the shelf. But No key I am here inside, but no keyâ€¦.. Mystery? No way. I called my friend to notice I would be late, but there was no answer, so I sent an email. Then, I started searching. First of all. I moved the shelf to see if the key had fallen in the gap between the shelf and wall. But there was nothing. ï¼‘ï¼˜ï¼šï¼ï¼ There was still no key anywhere. I tried to recall what I did at the previous night. I attended toastmastersâ€™ meeting and then I went to the second party and then I had a third party just short time and went back home around 1130 pmâ€¦.? You my suspect I was drunk. But believe me, I wasnâ€™t drank much. I drank only a glass of beer and a glass of green tea milk cocktail, only. I swear. ï¼‘ï¼™ï¼šï¼ï¼ I got a phone call from my friend. ã€ŒYou got it?ã€ ã€ŒNot yetã€ ã€ŒDo you have any idea about where it is ?ã€ ã€ŒNo ideaã€ ã€ŒWell, I am hungry, so I will start my dinnerã€ ã€ŒSorryã€ [Never mind] I missed a special miss-based milk flavor nabe!!!

I used to have one, but several months ago, there was an incident that one of residents was broken into a stranger when he or she was out. Although there was noting stolen, for the safety concern, all keys of all residents were replaced to new and more complicate one. Since then I donâ€™t have a spare key. On the occasion of the replacement, we were reminded that even only single resident roses a key, all of our keys shall be replaced again because the keys are also used for the key of the building entrance too. The cost may be on you!!!!!!!!!! OH MY god!! ï¼’ï¼‘ï¼šï¼ï¼ There is still no key. I was almost crying. Why nobody helps me even though I was in such a serious trouble. I wish I would lose a mobile phone instead of a door key so that I could call the number and I may know where it is by the ringing sound. Waitâ€¦ I set it to manner mode always. More than that, I have no phone at home. It doesnâ€™t workâ€¦.! I was disappointed about myself. I tried to recognize this experience in a positive way. So, I tried to think it may be good idea to use this experience for my next speech because some senior member told me that the episodes especially something you fell must be good contents for the speech, ï¼’ï¼’ï¼šï¼ï¼ It has already passed the sweet dessert time. It is almost the closure of the dayâ€¦.. However; I still have no idea about the missing keyâ€¦.. I thought I would go out tomorrow without locking the door because I donâ€™t want to ask the building manager for a spare key. I donâ€™t want to let her know I lost a door keyâ€¦. However, it must not be a good idea, so only option I take is Searing searching searing!!! I decided to do as if it was police investigation. The principle of the investigation--- it is to look into carefully where the incident happened. This case, I must miss the key at the entrance. I again move the shelf and looked at the gap between shelf and wall. But nothing there again. Next I opened and closed the 2 drawler of the shelf, Open and close, open and close At that time! Careen I hear metallic sound I cannot believe it !!! The door key was in a very narrow space between the back of shelf and the back of drawler. Last night, when I put the key on the shelf it fell into the gap. Just hall in on! ï¼‘ï¼ï¼šï¼’ï¼ The investigation is done. Ladies and gentlemen, What is important for you? Now I would say it is time especially Time in the weekend. I donâ€™t west your precious time for just searching your key, so Let me remind you by this key note speech of please taking care of something important for you."
Japanese,"Seafood Fukubukuro I bought a fukubukuro (lucky bag) on internet. It is a seafood fukubukuro. I ordered it about a week ago, and I couldn't wait to receive it. Today, I received it. There were the following products in the box. a bag of oyster. a bag of scallop. ten legs of queen crab. a few sauries. a box of shrimp. a few steaks. and so on. Each time I eat oysters, I have a stomachache. So I don't like oysters. But I like the other foods! My freezer is full. I think how to cook them."
Japanese,"Can younger people teach older people? Question Some people think that there is nothing young people can teach older people. Others believe that young people can teach older people something. Which statement do you agree with and why? Include specific details and examples to support your choice. Answer I believe even though young people can teach older people. Of course, generally speaking, older people know many thing better than young people. On the other hand, young people are superior in certain categories, for example, how to use computers and internet, about subculture, and latest news. These knowledge areas require the young sense and flexible images. Therefore, I believe younger people and older people can teach each other."
Japanese,"The Phrase That I Had Mistaken For a Long Time Sometimes I wonder about what it would be like, if I started to learn English from the very beginning the way native speakers did. If I did it, I probably wouldnâ€™t wonder about something like this. I had been wondering about why â€œStand by meâ€ wasnâ€™t â€œStood by me.â€ Donâ€™t you understand why I had been wondering about such a thing? I started to learn English by memorizing its grammar in school the way almost Japanese people did. So, probably because of it, I had mistaken it for a while that we should have wrote the verb as past voice automatically, if words like, â€œby someoneâ€ came up. (Should I write this sentence as simple past?) Now I think why I didnâ€™t wonder about why â€œStand by meâ€ wasnâ€™t â€œBeing stood by meâ€ or why â€œSomeone is stood by meâ€ in the first place (Is it like a punishment?) Itâ€™s so funny. Even if there are many Japanese people who started to learn English the way I did, people who wonder about the same thing as me might be a few. Donâ€™t worry! Now I understand what â€œStand by meâ€ means."

Japanese,"Japanese-style painting is a dead genre On Dec.2nd one of the most famous Japanese painter HIRAYAMA Ikuo was dead. One of the his work was offered to Yakushi-ji temple in Nara prefecutre, Japan. Yakushi-ji temple is a historical temple. It was built in B. C. 710. Therefore Yakushi-ji temple has a lot of masterpieces in various periods such as sculptures of Budda, picture of goddes and beautiful stupa. When I heard the news that Mr. Hirayama's work was offered to Yakushi-ji, I felt ""Oh my God! In 100 years or so, our descendants will see that picture and think 'Wow, the masterpiece of that time is not so good.' I'm shame of this. He is not representative of our periods."" I think he is a good painter but not great. I think painting, especially for Japanese-style painting, is a dead genre. Some genre of art is dead when the masterpiece appear and people think any successor can't make better one than it. I think painting was dead at the middle of 20th centuries when Picasso, Gogh or Chirico painted masterpieces. If I could choose some works which is dedicated to Yakushi-ji temple, I would choose works of Modern Art such as Media art, installation and so on. I think these should be representative of our periods.

I'm wondering if you say ""so are you"" to mean ""you are under the same condition"". 2nd question I saw an expression ""think positive"". Is this diffrent from ""think positively""? I think they may be slightly different but almost same. I guess ""think positive"" is ""think a positive thing"" or ""think in a positve way"" in a complete sentence. I hope you give me some comments on my questions and correction on this diary too. Thank you."

Then we played football together :D They sort of reminded me of my elementary school days. Since there are lots of the way of expressions to say something, it's difficult to learn what expression is the best depending on the situation. In a TV program. I heard ""I can dig it"" and I searched for the meaning of it. According to a website which translates English to Japanese, it means ""ã‚ã‹ã£ãŸã€‚ "" in Japanese.

I think it's a kind of propaganda that U. S. has reduced and he leads another counties how to do over 80% of nukes. Probably Pentagon does not want to explain what does thisÂ number mean.Â Remember, the U. S has developed MIRV (Multiple Independently-targetable Reentry Vehicle) and has deployed already. That means even ONE ICBM or SLBM can destroy many cities at one time. Why do we need over 5 thousand of them? Are we certainly that total destructive power of nukes has decreased or not? The world has probably not changed. I mean human-being might not be changed. Once we have a tool, we won't miss chances to use. History says so. Okay, keep eyes on those who want use their ""airms"".

Antimoon. com http://www.antimoon.com/ Most of the author's advice and opinions were what I had heard about or read before, but this one was new to me: ""We can damage our English by writing and speaking incorrectly. Do not write or speak unless you learn to do so correctly by reading and listening much enough. "" I partially agree with his opinion. I think nothing we first learned can be easily changed whether it is correct or not. Because we intuitively feel so, most of us give up using foreign languages. The author gave up getting things corrected by others. I think it is already out of date. Think about people who correct our native language, they are first our parents, then teachers and classmates, and finally all the other native speakers including ourselves. Now we've got sites like Lang-8, so I think the day has come when we should keep in touch with foreign language advisers, free of charge. I'd like to mention other topics from the site in other entries."
Japanese,"Do you wear a helmet when you ride a bicycle? In Japan, many people ride bicycles, but almost no one wears a helmet. When I was in Canada, I was surprised that many cyclists wore helmets and rode very fast. Sometimes, I almost collided with them while I walked along the sidewalk. In Japan, most cyclists donâ€™t ride as fast as cyclists in Canada, and they also obey traffic lights. Cyclists are treated as the same as pedestrians in Japan. They ride on the same sidewalks as for pedestrians and usually, they are careful not to bump into them. If you come to Japan and see bicycles parked alongside the road, you may see some differences between your county and ours. Firstly, the most popular bicycles in Japan are the ones for women, called ""Mamachari""(ãƒžãƒžãƒãƒ£ãƒª), although they are ridden by both men and women. They canâ€™t be ridden very fast and they are mainly used for going to work, school, or shopping. Secondly, in Japan, you can park your bicycle in front of shops without paying any fees and without fear of theft. (But you need to lock it.) Everyday, I go to work by bicycle without wearing a helmet and I've never been in any accidents. So I don't think it is dangerous. In your country, do you wear a helmet when you ride a bicycle?"
Japanese,"Education in Japan I think that some people have the insights into education of own country. Because some people already know that it is important for country's future to raise level of education. I think Japanese education style is prior to memorize rather than style of practical education. This style is seems to be typical of Japanese education policy. Some politicians, however, changed the style and applied the new policy until pretty recently. This new policy is ã‚†ã¨ã‚Šæ•™è‚²(Yutori education). Yutori is leeway.(I'm not sure. sorry) Yutori education have some policy that it is prior to increase considering time rather than memorize time, and increase active learning time in spite of compulsory memorizing time. That is to say, new policy dislike old cramming education style. Nowadays, Yutori education was reviewed by some intellects, and this new policy abolished. Some intellects and people think that Yutori education lead to decline of a level of achievement because Yutori education decline of some lesson at school. I agree this abolition because I think a lot of knowledge generate ideas and wisdom."

Japanese,"My thought about a part time job. Question: Today many Japanese college students have a part-time job. What do you think about it? My thought: In my opinion, it is worth having a part-time job for Japanese college students. You may say that they should concentrate on studying while they are students of college. However, having it is a good experience for them before they really have a job after graduating from college. Therefore, there is no reason to think that they shouldn't have a part-time job."
Japanese,"my first dairy In this morning,I watched the movie ,""seven samurais"" which was made by AKIRA KUROSAWA. The movie was made in 1954,so it uses only two color,that is,black and white. I write down the summary of the story here. Farmers in a village asked for help to seven samurais,because they were offten attacked by barbarous samurais. Seven samurais made a detailed strategy to defeat barbarous samurais,and pointed to the farmers. Seven samurais and the farmers cooperated and fighted. This movie is very old,so quality of screen is worse than today's movies,but it was as powerful and interesting as today's movies."

Japanese,"FIFA Women's World Cup Germany 2011 I'm happy to hear that Japan won against Germany in FIFA Women's World Cup Germany 2011. It is said that the German national team is the strongest, and they have an advantage because of their home this tournament. Sadly, the game wasn't broadcasted, so I had no choice but to watch it on Youtube. The women's football is not popular in Japan, Actually, I know just one player's name, she is Sawa. Semi-final will take place on 13th midnight. It won't be broadcasted as well, but I can find out some web-site broadcasting on live. Popular women's sports in Japan are figure-skating, golf, marathon and skiing.

What kind of women's sports is the most popular in your country?"

Japanese,"Japanese Collage Life There are several characteristics in Japanese collage life. It may differ from ones of other countries in that it has clear separation between arts and science, system of entrance examination, and early job hunting. First, there is usually a clear line between arts and science in Japanese University, even in undergraduate. Arts faculty, which is called ""Bunkei(literacy system)"" in Japan, mainly concerns about human activities, such as philosophy, theology, literature, history, business, jurisprudence, politics, and so on. On the other hand, people in science faculty or ""Rikei(science system)"" in Japanese, deal with natural or scientific activities, like mathematics, informatics, industry, chemistry, physics, or medicine. Because each kind of school requires different skills or knowledge, their entrance examination also differs. Science students-to-be are required to have more of math, chemistry, and physics, while art students-to-be need deeper knowledge about Japanese, history, or politics. High school students usually have to choose art course or science course in their second or third year to prepare for different exams. Second, Japanese collage students start job hunting relatively earlier. They in general start it from the middle of their third year, and it ends at the beginning of fourth year. So, they have about one year to play along. In fact, this system is often criticized because it allots less time to students to study, which violates essential purpose of university. Of course, not all students do job hunting. Some of them want to go master course of doctor course to be a professor, or go to professional school to be a lawyer or other professionals. The proportion of those students is bigger in science faculties than in arts ones. This is partly because higher skill and knowledge is required for succeeding if you want to make use of them. These are the characteristics which I think important to know about Japanese collage life. I'd be happy if you get interested in them. So, what shall I write about next? http://lang-8.com/journal/94532 I still want you to request me!"

Japanese,"Porto is the city where the witch Kiki landed?! Iâ€™ll start with what Porto is like. Porto is located 300km north from Lisbon. The river Douro runs in the city from east to west, north and south of the city have lots of slopes. Itâ€™s a city built in a rolling hilly terrain. It has about 300,000 population and the center of commerce in Portugal. The whole of the city is registered as the world heritage. The scenery of the city is amazingly beautiful, and Iâ€™ve heard that it is one of the model cities of â€œKikiâ€™s delivery serviceâ€ which was directed by Mr. Hayao Miyazaki. Actually I thought that the scenery from the south bank looked like the one that Kiki who went to her training saw from the sky fling on a broom. Porto is not so big city, but it has a lot of features like wineries of Porto wine in the southern area of the River Douro. We slept like the dead due to the movement of the previous day. We woke up late slowly and had a breakfast at the hotel. Then we headed to the bus company to get the ticket to return to Madrid on the following day. After we got a ticket, we took a walk to Jardim do Palacio de Cristal. It was full of nature, and we could enjoy relaxing and walking. I thought it was the best spot for dating. It had a nice scenery to heal and relax our feelings. However the park was bigger than we expected, so we were exhausted from waking around. Although we planned to the church San Francisco before noon, we lost our way in the city again. So we were so hungry that we went south to the River Douro to eat something first. There were an array of restaurants along the River Douro, and we could see lots of colorful parasols in front of them. We ordered and drank a glass of beer under the parasol from noon with avoiding midday sun. What an easygoing and happy vacation we had!! I ate a heavy potatoes and beef flavored with mustard dish for lunch. Potato, beef, potato and beefâ€¦â€¦. It tasted good, but itâ€™s too big for me to eat it up. If I ate like this every day, I would become like a piglet in no timeâ€¦â€¦ I went with the slow flow, relaxed and had a great food and drink and talked a lot with my friend endlessly, then it spent about 2 hours having lunch. Because time presses me all the time in Japan, the life in Portugal was awesome pleasant like it melt me and my bones away. After our long lunch, we got off our lazy butt and started to move to the church San Francisco we had planned to go to in the morning."

I was afraid of it, so I walked slowly by the wall, even though I was going to be late to the work. At that time a suit man walked fastly in the centre of the road. His walking looked not to afraid of the snow. I thought he might fall over it, and I was right. He lose his walking and slid down fastly on the road. I was sorry for him but it looked funny. Before him there was a car staying crosed on the road. Because of that car, he could stop sliding far away. It isn't good that was funny, but whenever I thought about this, it made me funny. I'm sorry for him to that."

Before I talk about snowboard, I'll tell about my recent life. :) I'm in Innsbruck where is located Tyrol, Eastern Austria. Why am I in Austria? That's because I am here to study as an international student. I arrived in here two weeks ago. Here is really beautiful. Everywhere is fantastic. I can even see snow of the mountain in the room. :) Before coming austria, I've made many plans. The first thing was to snowboard at Alps. Innsbruck is well known for winter sports. Although this city is small, but we can enjoy every winter sport such as ski, snowboard, ski-jump and bobsleigh. That's why I made a plan to snowboart first. Now I'll tell about my first snowboarding experience in Alps. Actually I've worked at ski resort in Korea. So I can snowboard. I thought I am not a best snowboarder but a good rider. But Alps mountain was so different with Korea. First of all, taking cable car to go ski resort, I was so surprised and overwhelmed by high mountain and fantastic view. So I felt I was afraid of snowboarding even before starting. In fact, the mountain was so great but I could not enjoy very much. I had a hard time snowboarding and was injured. I couldn't easily forget to snowboard although I had a hard time and was injured. :) Anyway I did that!!! and next time I must enjoy snowboard!!!"

Korean,"Refusion. Once I talk with a guy even for a short time, I can tell if he is interesting person or not. If I don't find a guy charming while talking with him, he won't be charming no matter how he tries in the future. So when guys who are not interesting ask me for a date, I should find the way to refuse it politely. So usually I tell them that I'm not in the mood for a boyfriend but then guys tell me they just want to be friends with me. It is always difficult to refuse a date because I don't want to look all concited but I really don't want to go out when it is not the with a right person. I don't do anything that can causes misunderstandings to guys because I don't want to hurt anyone. I had a lot of experionces like this and I realized male and female can't be close friends."

Korean,"Iâ€™m sorry butâ€¦Shall I come up to you? During the travel, I saw lots of couples. Especially the couples in tourist attraction site look happy than any other poeple.(Thatâ€™s true. Go to Shtephan dome in Vienna. You can see the happiest people in the world. But if you go out of Ring of Vienna, you can see just normal people in your country.) Anyway thatâ€™s so sweet! Is there any chance for me to do this before the honey moon? Haha.. Anyways I hope to talk about the situation when I take this kind of photos. To be honest, itâ€™s embarrassing, because I feel like Iâ€™m bothering them. The other hand, Iâ€™m thinking Iâ€™ll get what I want from your couple. So I just keep waiting until something happens, holding the camera on my righ hand. As the something progresses, Iâ€™m busy taking them. Actually I badly want to say, â€œIâ€™m sorry butâ€¦Shall I come up to your couple? My lens is not so good to take picture in the distanceâ€¦So can I take pictures from here?â€ (Actually my lens is Sigma 2770mm. So there is somewhat limitation. But I donâ€™t blame my lens because I have my health foot, which mean I can approach the object. Moreover my lens is doing its best all the time. Iâ€™m pretty sure. But the real problem of my lens is when I take a picute of lanscapes. Angle of lens is too narrow to take a picture of big building or spectacular view. So nowdays Iâ€™m using this method that after taking a serious of picutre, I combine all into one) Anyway this is how I got this pictures. Especilly, as for second picture taken in Paris(The first one is from Flrence) I badly wanted to get permission from them because the view from the front of them was much better than the back. A lot of tree without leaves stretching their arms into the skyâ€¦really nice background in comparison to the couple with warm heart. But at that time I was exhausted due to the long trip, so I didnâ€™t have enough bravery to speak to them. But now Iâ€™m regretting that I missed the good scean."

He said that a kind of curse exists there. Olympics attracts many people to the venue and draws a great many investments. However, sudden concentration of capital precipitates rising bubble in local land price. As a result, those who are living where take a exciting event might not sustain life in their home. Beside, a large proportion of fund might come from tax that is collected from victims of the event. It seems as though they stifle themselves. Anyway with all of the dark side I wish that 2018 Olympic games is to be success. -------- Your advice is more than welcome, thank you."

Korean,"War of mothers This is my essay. ""Hello? Oh my god! honey~ My mom is driving me crazy! When I leave Ga-yeon (daughter of my cousin) to my mom, She always..."" My cousin starts to complain about Her mother's way of nursing. In this matter, every mom has her own belief of nursing. One of them is coming out of Alpha moms. Alpha mom is the mother who uncovers their child's talent and, by using her outstanding ability to collect information, makes her child educated well. They search the information of nursing by using internet when they get over the situation being a mother. Alpha moms consider nursing as a job and try to be child's study manager. These ways, they become a mother over-solicitous for her childrenÂ´s education. This phenomenon is influenced by the social situation that sets high value on special-purpose high school and international middle school. Due to spread of alpha mom, children's education level gets higher. But expectation of the mothers makes the burden too heavy for their children. So the children lose their drive to study. And one student per day commits suicide because of a gloomy look of their grade. Because of these social maladies, Beta moms come on the scene. Beta moms look upon child's happiness through freedom as important. Beta moms want their children to choose what they want, and place emphasis on their choices. They think that developing autonomy in self-control circumstance is the most important thing because children have their learning ability in their intellectual development. Many experts side with beta moms. They stress the children's freedom. If someone restricts children's freedom, children would suffer a developmental stage. Even though they divided sharply, I think they are not so different. Both of them emphasize the love and support of parents for their children. It's just difference of way. Whether mothers choose alpha mom or beta mom, the most important thing is the figure of mom from the point of children's eyes. If they thought ""I will be the person like my mother"" when they saw their mothers, those mothers would be the best moms."

Korean,"Three Effective Ways of Spending Time Wisely on the Bus When you are getting on a bus, somehow, you may feel that you waste your precious time because usually, you only sit on your seat doing nothing. However, there are three effective ways of spending valuable time on the bus. The first way is listening to something with your mp3 player. For example, listening to music you like for your boring time on the bus or to something helpful like English conversation for proving your ability of English. The second way is reflecting on your day and planning. Reflecting on the day you have spent is very important. If you do it, you will spend your time very well without any mistakes. Planning is also important. If you plan your day, you will be able to handle some problems to happen wisely and you will not forget important things to do. The third way is looking out the bus. these days, many people live very busily as though they are chased by time. They are so busy that they can't afford to look around. So, during the time on the bus, just look beautiful landscape and passing people on the street. Do you spend a lot of time on the bus? Then, use these three ways and spend your time effectively for your long boring time on the bus."

Then older people wish the best wish of younger people and give some pocket money. In this day, Koeans play a lot of traditional games. Yoot is a board game of Korea. They use four bars in this game. It is a popular family game and played between two teams. A playing method is throw four bars together and checks their shape. Then they can move our chess piece. To win the game, chess pieces have to arrive the goal first. Another game is flying a kite. They believe the bad force will fly away with the kite."
Korean,"Shopping Online Versus Shopping at Stores Since the advent of the Internet, more and more people have been using the Internet not only to communicate and share information between people but also to shop online. These days, shopping online has become the trend in Korea. Some people stress on a variety of advantages of shopping online while others insist that shopping at stores has more advantages. These two different types of shopping style can be compared in three points : convenience, price and security. First of all, let's talk about the convenience of each shopping style. Online shopping doesn't require spending time on going to different stores to compare prices or to purchase goods. What purchasers have to do is just to click the mouse on the computer to choose products they want at home. That's impossible for offline shoppers. However, online shoppers are unable to touch or try on the products they choose and also have to wait for a while until the goods are delivered to their home. In some cases, online shoppers are very disappointed with what they have received because the color or texture of the products are different from what they expect. Another comparison is price. Shopping online allows consumers to buy goods at more resonable and lower prices than offline shopping. For example, I usually get a 10% or sometimes 15% discount when I buy books at online bookstores. Of course, books are delivered for free if the cost is over 10,000won. However, if I buy the same books at bookstores such as Kyobo Bookstore or Youngpooing Bookstore, I can't get any discount. However, shopping online doesn't secure the exclusion of any fake or weak online stores. For instance, sometimes purchasers need to receive a refund or to exchange a product to another one when the product has some problems. In that case, the purchasers may have trouble getting a refund if they have bought the products at a counterfeit or small online stores. Unlike online shopping, products purchased at stores are refundable and exchangeable without any difficulty as long as the receipt is not expired. In the end, shopping online and shopping at sores possess their own appealing merits to attract shoppers. Online shoppers can save time from wandering around stores looking for the best foods by just clicking the mouse attached the computer at home. On the other hand, offline shoppers can enjoy shopping in a charming mood of stores, touching and trying on the items they want to get. Considering all these facts, shoppers feel enjoyable while shopping in their preferable way."

Korean,"Presentation Good afternoon. This is Jaehun. Today Iâ€™m going to talk about Korean tourist attractions. Travelling is always fun. Experiencing new culture and seeing the actual lives of local people are full of exciting. If my friends who is from another country visit my country, I want to give them an unforgettable memory and good impression on Korea â€¢ We have a lot of attraction in my country. Seoul, Jeju Island, many beautiful beach and we also have nice traditional culture. â€¢ At first Iâ€™m going to talk about attractions in Seoul. â€¢ South Korea's most famous historical tourist attractions include the ancient capitals of Seoul. â€¢ Most of the international tourists come to Seoul to experience both the classical and modern aspects of Korean culture. â€¢ â€¢ Look! This is Sungnyemun or more commonly known as Namdaemun is a historic gate located in the heart of Seoul. â€¢ It means literally ""Great Southern Gate.â€ â€¢ But unfortunately it was burned by drunken person few years ago. It was very sad story. So if you visit Seoul, you may not see it. â€¢ Even though you canâ€™t see it, I want to say about it. Because It stood for Seoul. As a matter of fact, It was the first natural treasure in Korea. And It is also a precious cultural heritage. So we are restoring now. Maybe you can see it after 2012. â€¢ â€¢ These are our traditional palaces. Seoul has many palaces. Changgyeong palace was built by Koryo dynasty and Gyeongbok palace and Changdeok palace was built by Joseon dynasty. Above this we have a lot of another palaces. â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ This picture is Changgyeong palace. It registered as a World Heritage. â€¢ And this picture is Biwon Garden that is beside of Changgyeong palace. This place is one of the most beautiful pond of Korea. â€¢ Biwon Garden is typical of palace back yards where kings and other members of the royal family would go to relax. â€¢ â€¢ This picture is Gyeongbok palace and the biggest palace of Korea. â€¢ â€¢ This is Korean Folk Village â€¢ At here, you can wear Korean traditional dress, see the buildings and also you can try to making potteries by hand. â€¢ This picture is Korean traditional wedding culture. â€¢ Next picture is Korean traditional instruments and dancing. When I tried to dance, It was very difficult. â€¢ If you visit here, you can learn about how to make potteries by hand. â€¢ â€¢ This picture is Han River Park which located along the riverside of the Han River â€¢ Han River is the main artery in Korea. It gets through Seoul City that likes Boston. And It is also another wonderful place to relax and view â€¢ Han River has 29 bridges and very wonderful and I recommend that go to Han River Park at night. If I were tourist, I wouldnâ€™t miss this view. â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ There is Jeju Island. It is the biggest island of Korea. Also very beautiful. So Every year many couples are visit here. â€¢ Sightseeing in jeju has been supported by the wonderful coastal climate. â€¢ And there is a purity and freshness about the air and water of Jeju. It makes the island one of the most populated regions in the world. â€¢ These are dolhareubangs. It means grandfather made by rock. It stands for Jeju Island. You can find anywhere in Jeju If you donâ€™t see the dolhareubang, There are not Jeju. â€¢ This is beach of Jeju. â€¢ I like this place. These flower are rape blossoms If you clime the Hanra moutain that in the Jeju, you can find this place. â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ Busan is the second largest city of Korea. And there are operates as the main port for the international cargo in the country. â€¢ And This picture is one of the famous beach in Korea. This beach called by Haeundae. â€¢ I think this picture took at off-season rate. As a matter of fact, in peak season, there are almost 1 million people visit here at same day. â€¢ As far as Iâ€™m concerned, Haeundae is better than Miami beach. Because we can drink on the beach legally â€¢ Anyway, If you went to Busan, also you should see night view."

Korean,"this is about the movie I watched last night I watched the movie that named ""perfume"" It's about the man who has talent of sence of smell. He was born in paris that filled with disgusting smell at that time. He didn't know that he has great talent nobody hasn't until he met a beautiful girl who sold a few plums. A sweet smell from her cativated him like a magic. Meanwhile, he was aware of the perfume. Finally, all he wanted was to change a sweet smell from her to the perfume. The more he thought about that, The more anxious he got. After then he started to go his way that was meant to be. He figured out how to make a perfume from people by killing peoples. I think this movie has the meaning of love and possetion. There is fine line between love and possetion. The reason he had to kill girls implied that he loved them that much. He just wanted them by taking them. Because he didn't know how to express the love. But the movie says that love doesn't mean possetion like that you should take care a flower, instead of picking the flower if you like it, indeed."

Korean,"Struggle for cheaper college expense A few days ago, I heard the news that college students assembled to demand cheaper college expense. Everyone except for Koreans may wonder about why they come outside and stand their ground forcibly even during the final exam period. Don't be surprised at how much they spend every year. The money reaches about 10,000,000 won.( 9500-9,600 us dolloars) It is the highest in the world. According to the news article, students attending universities in Tokyo pay just half of ours. As a matter of fact, it was the present president's electional pledge that he would achieve a half-priced tuition to take off the burdens from parents as well as students. To make matters worse, to my amazement, followers who support the president do not remember promising the policy 4 years ago!!!! I can't believe it. One thing that I can do at this moment is to wait and see longer."

Korean,"volunteering I had been to 'Flower Village' to join in the volunteer work. It was difficult but i think i had a good job. Today, I'd like to talk about the importance of volunteer work for people in need. There are many people who need other's help, such as the sick, the poor, and people suffering from accidents. I think the desire to help miserable people is a part of human nature. Helping others can give helpers themselves deep satisfaction. Now most students participate in volunteer work for poor people or for their community. The experience of helping others or working for a neighborhood would give students great pride. Therefore, I think students should join in the volunteer work more actively."

Korean,"China and Korea Traditionally, Korea people have been affected by Chinese in cultures and customs. For example, our family has a ritual called ""Jesa"" on every big holiday like the new yearâ€™s day and the moon festival. The ritual came from the Confucianism. We have grown up reading some Chinese novels like ""Sam-Kuk-Ji"", and ""Seo-U-Ki."" Even some old people were very proud of saying they read the book series for several times. Some people have thought Chinese have a bigger body than Korean because we are in different ethnic groups. Around 10 years ago, I could have the first chance to meet Chinese, first, people from Taiwan and then main land China. They spoke a language I could never understand, which made me so wonder how people from two nations were able to communicate for several thousand years and how so many cultures could be transferred between two countries. Frankly, I got impression that they were poor and little tiny but I started to enjoy their food especially ones from ""Schezan"" area."

But soooooooooooooooooooooooo expensive ã… ã… 1. Presto - manly(design) 2. Cooky - girly(design) Those two models performances are similar. Therefore, I wanted to a presto model.

I was so depressed to know that and gave up playing the piano in early 10s. In the moment, the drive to learn the í•´ê¸ˆ, is not to be a skillful player. I just like to play the í•´ê¸ˆ joyfully, regarding í•´ê¸ˆ as one of best friends. Someday it would be great if I play with likely minded people who love music. But as you know, I'm not good at playing something. So it took so much just to master basic tune: CDEFG. Fortunately,I didn't gave up it at this time. So I could play some children songs this month. It was awesome to play the í•´ê¸ˆ though I frequently played out of tune. Sorry and thanks for my neighborhood who have endured my awful play. Dear Lang-8 friend, could I ask you which kind of music instruments is best for you? Thesedays, have you got some music lessons? It would be a great pleasure to hear your story. As always, thanks for reading my journal."

Right, recently I drink some or a cup of coffee when I am studying. but I guess it must be not a factor, I had been sleepy too when I didn't drink.

Korean,"Is there android's app for Lang-8? My smart phone is HTC Desire which is very handy to write twitter or something. Starting Lang-8 these days, I try to check Lang-8 by web browser with my phone. However, it is quite a inconvenient environments due to smaller screen than size of web page. Providing ease of use, smart phone garners fame as a tool for Lang-8. Even if an app didn't exist, I'd like to see your way of how to fully exploit these equipment. ps. I am expecting to have iPad2 after a few weeks. Do iOS have good one?"
Korean,"2011, March, Tokyo When I'm a middle school student. I loved Japanese Animations. One day, in Art class time, teacher saw to us ""laputa castle in the sky"". It was very impress. So I started web surfing and found Japanese animations. About three years later, I almost can understand easy Japanese speaking. Like a daily talk. One day, I was a part time job in convenience store. It was near tourist hotel. So everyday, I could meet Japanese tourists. They speak each other, Using Japanese. I can barely understand what they say together. But I can't speak Japanese. Some ladies, asked to me find some food that inserted ""Kimchi"" flavor. In that time, I pick the one, but ladies talk each other. ""I hate tuna. It added tuna. Tuna's chewing feeling is not good."" It was Japanese. But I could understand. It was very fun to me. So I picked the another one and she satisfied. After years. 2011, the March. I was in Tokyo. I was trip to another country the first time. And I experienced an earthquake first time. In that time, I didn't know what is happening. Some ladies drove stroller, sudden shaking was started. That time, I just landed from boat. So I confused. I thought that time 'Oh, look at me. My leg is shaking. Stupid boat.' But everybody shook that time. I run and ladies run too. In running, I shouted one of ladies ""Earthquake!? earthquake!?"" She was nodding to me and drove stroller very fast. I met Korean guys that time. They didn't understand what's going on just like me. We told each other and smoke together. We worried about that situation. But no answer. We said goodbye each other. Then I resumed my solo trip. That day, I didn't understand what terrible disaster just started. I can't ride train cause of earthquake, and road were full of cars. Tokyo people just stayed in station almost midnight. They did not look terrified. I tried to call my home. but line was too busy. I could't make it. It was very impressed experience. I was alone, and some gigantic disaster stroke a country. I was perfectly alone that time. After three days. My trip was over. Almost half month in Tokyo. They were kind. And looks like us. pray for japan. god bless Japan. no more earthquake."

Doctor said ""since the cutter might have been rusty. I prescribe medicine for 3 days and a preventive injection against tetanus."" (tetanus is not common disease these days in korea) I just thought It's just simple happening, but, the Pharmacist and doctor think it can become serious. ah~~ so.. people said ""knowledge is power"". isn't it suitable ? ^^"
Korean,"I'm planning my own life. I'm 21,but also I'm 23 in a Korean way of counting my age. anyway, recently I've been thinking about my life so far and where I'll be in future. and I think I haven't considered about what I really wanted to do. for a long time I've wanted to learn Spanish. but I haven't because of a lack of time and money. but these are just lame excuses. I could have learned Spanish if I had really had a fervor for learning Spanish. I have just lived my life with no passion and purpose. I'm ashamed and i want to change that. I set a goal of being able to speaking fluently in three languages; Korean(mother tongue) , English , and Spanish. even though now I can't speak a single word in Spanish and I'm not good at English, but I believe that at least in three years I'll be able to speak Spanish and English fluently. I don't think 21 is a late age to start something new. and I'll do my best to achieve the goal."
Korean,"Why did we start to eat dogs? From my point of view, it has something to do with our cuisine. Korean cuisine is not based on meats. Most of ingredients of Korean food is vegetables. So, Koreans need only small amount of meat for each time which makes cattle and pigs out of list. As a matter of fact, Koreans did not usually ate pork or beef unless it was a special days such as new year's day, Korean's thanks giving 'ì¶”ì„' or someone's marriage. Besides, we needed cows for farming and pigs for their interests since they're very prolific. How about chicken? They're not that big, so don't need to worry about left over. However, killing chicken means that there'll be no more eggs! I'm not fond of 'Dog soup'(ë³´ì‹ íƒ•) but I think it's just part of our culture. Thus, no one can blame Koreans for eating dogs. Interestingly, lots of people in the world eat or had eaten dogs and this fact is confirmed by various sources. French, for instance, had eaten them according to 'Malher et Denis's report'."

Korean,"it's a little bit long, but I appriciate your editting. There are many humane lives of various people and also there has his warm mind that he looked at. His humane mind that is contained in his essay gives me guidelines in my teacher life like a compass. Did I follow the spirits of the teacher? Did I respect my students as an owning personality? Isnâ€™t it true that I am only a teacher who delivers only knowledge? I am not sure that I can answer; YES. It has almost passed about 2 years when I became a teacher. Sometimes I shifted my anger to my students when I got stressed from daily routine even if I knew that is a bad behavior. It is very difficult to control, but through his life, I could strongly refresh my mind to be a real teacher again. His action in many fields and the fact that he donates his all money from extra work give me one more lesson; be a generalist. His action is not to accumulate fortunes and fame, but for people and his way of communicating with society. I want to be a well-prepared teacher, but this is challenging. Sometimes I found myself repeating a routine and taught my students without preparations. Compared with his life in various fields, it makes me ashamed. I think large amount of background and experience are needed to teach someone. That is why it could be my priceless treasure. I have to try to become a generalist who has self-confident, because it is not easy to obtain that kind of treasure. As was stated above, Gyeong Chul Park is a Korean surgeon as well as a generalist who does oneâ€™s best. As my roll models, he arouses me to look back over my career and suggests to become a teacher respecting studentsâ€™ personality and teaching well with more professional knowledge. There is an old saying; the life is a process. I resolve to try to leave my footsteps for others again."

Korean,"Osaka Trip 1 Osaka Trip 1 Last July, I've been to Osaka for 5days with my sibling. I had a funny story. My sister and I were going to go to Universal Studio by train. We had to go to Umeda Station, so I asked a Japanese who is a Japanese student of which this way is correctly going to Universal Studio. The Japanese student said that it is going to go to Universal Studio. And then we got on the train, and we were sitting in the chair while Japanese students who are high school girls were talking about something. I can't get the point Japanese, but I could understand some phrases. I guessed that they talked about us. She was looking for a subway linemap, then the other JP student ordered her to notice something. Ater that she tried to say that we should get off the train and then we can get on a rapid (express) train. When I heard her notice, we got off the train, and then we waited for an express train. However, It didn't arrive because the station isn't an express train station. I sensed it, but I didn't tell them know. One student was asking someone of something. The other student was still stand at a loss, so I questioned on why you are going to school to her to give her relex. In order to attend club, they were going to go to school on vacation. They said sorry to us, but I said we are OK. Even though they made a mistake, I was happy when I felt their mind they wanted to help foreingers. We got on a train again, and they laughed at me. It was not negative. I sensed that they found that I look like someone. When we arrived at a rapid train station, they noticed us, and then we got off the train. While we were going to the rapid train, they asked us of taking a picture. We took pictures together, and then we got on the express train. Until we leave, They waited. I was impressed of Japanese mature civic awareness. And I knew that I look like someone in Japan."

In this morning, one of the well known actress in Korea died herself at her home. She hanged herself. She's 40 and has two kids who are seperated from their father since divorce. She has been a top star for twenty years even though she has much difficulties. It was shocking in Korea. Because there was a rumor that she related to private liabilities of dead man who is actor and is her friend's husband. He died 15 days ago. Even though his death remains with doubt. She has rejected claims at a recent press conference. But it has spreaded on web quickly and badly. She has been under the stress. After the famous person died, it affects the ordinary people by implusing to commit suicide themselves like a way of group and series. And as it happens again, the social anxiety increses. It gives me feel blue and think about a power of rumor and a press power. I hope her family will not hurt more."
Korean,"17th, may, 2011 Rose and chick I saw a flower seller who was selling red roses and chicks at the subway exit yesterday. The red roses and chiks are mismatch from my point. I had no notion of buying and I passed her. However, the chicks that were contained in small paper box, brought back the memory that I and my sister played with them of my childhood. By the time I was almost six years old, one red-hot summer day, my sister bought a chick and paid for 300 won to street vendor. The chick covered with deep- yellow feather. I could just see two dots of black. I didn't thought that the chick is qute or pretty, also I never wanted to tough it, but it looked like small cotton candy. My sister put her life into the chick since that day, just like she will be with the chick, until it grow up and fly around the sky with puting his cockscomb on.(If the chicken can fly, it will be the bizarre scene. It would be funny, if it flap slowly its wings like wild goose.) My sister fed the chick everday. But it didn't eat the feed and finally dead, after a few days. Fortunately, it seemed her curiosity died down with the accident for a while. But I dreamed about the chick of the air for a while."

Korean,"Lent Have you heard about Lent? Last week a paster said that we had to take a pious attitude during Lent.

The date of Easter is decided each year according to a given rule of church and the date of Ash Wendnesday and the Good Friday depend on the date of Easter. Easter This year is April 12th, so Ash Wendnesday was Feburuary 25th and Good Friday is April 10th. Many christians fast on Ash Wendnesday and Good Friday and the mony to save with fast is given to the poor people. I think that`s a good thing to do and I could fast one day on Good Friday without any difficulties. Remember 'Love makes you in peace!'"
Korean,"Today, I will Introduce a movie, The title is "" A man"" I saw the movie last 1month ago. The main actor is WonBin who is very handsom and tough. Actually, the actor's playing was not so good. but this movie is not. In this movie, he is so emotional and has a sensitivity. That is one of a reason why I recommend the movie. On the other side, the story is speedy and not bored so I didn't know the time is gone. this movie like a ""Taken"" in American movie. The story is like too. In ""Taken"", The father rescued a kidnapped daughter, But in ""The man"", the man who is the girl's neighbor rescued kidnapped a girl. The Main actors job is State secret agents too. so, I like two movies. Anyway, we have to look the point of the movie is a really like the action. Especilly, The last scene that the main actor struggle with all bad men is very cool and exciting. If you didn't see the movie, go to a theater. I think it's not bad. But it have a lot of cruel scenes. for exmaple, the humen traffickers take many organs from people even live men too. So I recommond that children and pregnant women don't see the movie."

Korean,"To introduce myself Hello. Iâ€™m Star. My Korean name is Sung Hee Bae. Iâ€™m computer programmer. Iâ€™ve worked for 2 years. I quited my first company last week and I started to work in new company. So Iâ€™ve spent hard time for adapting to new circumstance. But I think itâ€™s very exciting to start something new. I feel gald at my first job computer programmer. Well, Let me say two things I like. I like blogging. I have had my own for five years. Four years while operating the blog, I have met a lot of people through the blog and I got closer with my friends. I also like to visit blogs as much as I operate mine. I have subscrived to many blogs through the RSS reader provided by Google. Compared to books, I think blogs are much closer to real time. It is more sincere because it's not restricted to a certain format. So I think the blogs are closer to real life than the books. When I visit famous blogs, I can see that they are ordinary people as well. They repeat making mistakes, feeling pain and learning new things. When I read sad stories, I also get sad. If Bloggers do something great, I also really get happy. When I see people worry I also think about my life. There is nothing like a person's life which can be empty, beautiful and exciting. So, I like blogging. And I like learning foreign languages."

Korean,"How can we be a nice co-worker? As you know, in companes, there are very many workers, and we can call them co-workers except you. However, there are serious workers, bad workers, nice workers, stupid workers, etc. I write and essay about the qualities that we need if we want to be a nice co-workers, thus I will mention about bad, and nice co-workers. First of all, I will tell you about the quality that I guess. I think being helpful, and kind. Here are my explanations. First, we have to be very helpful to another workers. I will tell you a kind of example. You are worker, and I am your co-worker. There are something happened in your house so you have to go to your home, however the boss said to you, ""You should finish this work or you can't go to your home. But, if you really want to go, say to your co-worker please do my work instead of me."" So you are begging to me. However, if I don't allow, I can be a kind of bad co-worker, and if I allow, I can be a nice co-worker. But, I don't think I can't be called a bad co-worker although I didn't allow. It can be a normal, but please think about this example generally because it is an kind of example. Also, if you can't come to the company, the very nice co-worker will come to the company instead of him although today is his holiday. We don't need to behave like that. Don't forget it is just a kind of example. Next is about being kind. If we are very kind to the workers, they will like you and help you sometimes when you have to do a kind of very difficult things. For example, you are worker and I am your co-worker. And you are doing something very hard, and the nice co-worker will help you and bad co-worker will not help you. To sum up, if we want to be a good co-worker, we should be kind, and helpful. This is the end of my essay."

Korean,"English writing# TOPIC: I think there is life outside of Earth. TOPIC: I think there is life outside of Earth. Thought1: The NASA scientist found fossilized evidence from outer space. Thought2: These meteorites used to hold water and organic material essential for life. A couple of hundred years ago, people could never imagine there were other places which were very far for theriselves but which are totally not that far away nowadays thanks to highly developed transportations and communications. There were always other places far from themselves at the opposite sites, they could believe it though. What they believed already appeared to be wrong because science and technology have highly developed and then we could know more things like ""the earth is round"". What if I said to them in the past ""the earth is round""? Almost all the people might consider me as a fool or something because they couldn't believe that before. I don't think what almost all the people believe is always true. Even though science says it coudn't be possible there are some other life in the other world on the space, I wouldn't believe what it says one hundred percent because it could appear to be wrong in the future as what it have done in the past. According to the thoughts you gave me, it seems the contemporary science also says it could be possible there is life outside of Earth so I have no reasons why I don't believe in extraterrestrial life. If it were possible, I wish I could check what the world in the future looks like because I'm very curious about it. I think the science couldn't help but must be developed because people are very eager to cure their curiosity as they want to quench their thirst. Who knows what the world in the future looks like?"

Kayageum is tranditional instrument of Korean. I hope to play the Kayageum~<3 -bananamilk â˜†INTRODUCEâ˜… ê°€ì•¼ê¸ˆ(Kayageum) Kayageum is one of the popularly used Korean traditional string instruments. Its body is made of paulownia tree and its twelve strings are made of the threads from cocoons. Its origin goes back to 2,000 years but its current shape and structure were created about 1,400 years ago by King Gashil of Kaya, a southern Kingdom in the Korean Peninsular. U-reuk of Kaya is one of famous musicians of Kayageum and introduced this string instrument to Shilla Dynasty, a Neighbouring country in the same Korean Peninsular, but later on conquered Kaya. Kayagum was named after Kaya, which literally means 'the string from Kaya'. It was introduced to Japan around AD 9C as Shiragigodo, Meaning 'the string from Shilla'. There are two kinds of Kayageum: Pupgum is more ancient form of Kayagum with the tradition of 1,400 years and Sanjo Kayagum is a more Modern Kayageum, Which was developed about 100 years ago. Sanjo Kayageum is more widely used today because of its flexibility to accommodate modern music. by : (http://www.hanstring.com/main2.html)"

Vietnamese,"Parents' Teaching When we were children, we thought everything was just simple. However, when we become adults our thoughts change to other ways. life makes us get older and older. The more we grow up, the more we know the world is so large. we taste feelings of stumbles to know how to stand up. Our parents teach us to be honestly always, however that is not always true because we know that sometimes dishonesty is better. a honest saying can kill a patient, otherwise a dishonest saying can help the patient live longer. Our parents teach us to be generous always and forgive others mistakes, so we want to forgive others mistakes, however someone never wants to do so and they cause hurt to us. after that we are getting to know how to cope with (face) such things. are our parents wrong? no, what they teach are just base and we will reach many pitfalls in our lives that they can not foresee. we must have enough intelligence to know how to give our parents' teaching to reality and intelligent people will go on intelligent ways"

Also by tiny leaves,it help cactus can avoid losing water evaporation. So after the rainfall,cactus have enough water to use until the next rainfall.

Vietnamese,"THE POWER OF SMELL One night, I was walking alone into the street and passing along book stores, cloth shops, fast food restaurants, street vendorsâ€¦on Bui Thi Xuan street, suddenly I stopped and entered Minh Tri fast food restaurant with well-known chicken bread. I didnâ€™t know why I bought one although I donâ€™t like eating bread, but the smell of bread attracted me as the special power that I could keep on a step forward. You know? It was like somebody said to me â€œhurry, hurry up, buy it, so delicious!â€ I suddenly remembered my lesson â€œsmells sellâ€ I used to learnt, and I believed that artificial smells can influence our buying behavior. This is the reason why companies have been spending a lot of money to make synthetic fragrances sell customersâ€™ smell to sell products even they make customers remember the store later, so we, victims of smells sell, will come back for more. Each of business made their â€œfragrance planningâ€ to develop company such as: - Use computer-controlled machines to carry the smell out through the storeâ€™s air vents. - Make microwaveable foods smell good before theyâ€™re cooked. - Give customers coupons advertising car loans. - Put sweat odor on unpaid bills. - â€¦ And using smells to sell products were begun in 1966 when a company added lemon fragrance to its dish detergent. New uses for smells are being created every day, and that really influence customer behavior. In my opinion, store owners have abused chemicals in business to sell customers; moreover, that chemicals might affect our health because of air pollution which they have created. So, would you like to eat a candy with its natural smell or its fake scent? Are you still believe in qualified products that you want to buy?"

Vietnamese,Dear all friend's lang-8 I live in Vietnam. Nice to meet you!
Vietnamese,ooooo i want to travel other country when i'm young. i like to speak easy english. i want to knowledge
Vietnamese,"My essay This is my first time on Lang-8. I'm loaded with my works. Lots of things needed to be done: my thesis, my monograph, and a coming-soon GRE test. Well, because I don't know what I should write in my first post, I'll post one of my TOEFL essay. People should pay to use public transportation Some people consider that people have to pay fee to use public transportation in order to reduce burdens on goverment. I strongly disagree with that viewpoint, however. In my opinion, public transportation should be free to all people to reduce environmental problems, solve traffic jam in city and strengthen people's relationships Firstly, reducing environmental problems in cities are what I put in my priority. It's no doubt that waste gases from cars are one of the most important sources of air pollution in urban areas. The amount of waste gases will increase proportionally to the amount of cars moving in the streets. Thus, if people use buses for their transportation, a large number of private cars will be significantly decreased. This will not only improve air quality in cities but also create a healthier environment for all citizens. Additionally, petroleum using for cars will also decline and we could preserve this unrenewable kind of energy. Indeed, keeping free fee policy for transporters has a beneficial effect on environment. Secondly, solving traffic jam in cities deserves my consideration. Traffic jam has always been a serious issue in cities. It does not only seiously affect officer's working efficiency but also increase fuels consuming for cars. A plenty of cars in streets is the reason for this problem.. Therefore, when all people go to work by public vehicles, the streets will be more spacious and traffic jam will be solved easily. Nevertheless, it also prevents people from being suffered from accidents because buses are a very safe vehicle. In fact, the fewer cars in the cities, the fewer accidents occur. Finally, opportunities for people to strengthen their relationships affect my decision. I deeply believe that people will spend more time to visit their friends and relatives because they do not pay money for transportation. Moreover, in some cases people want to pay a visit to their friends but they do not have any space for parking. Thus, they will prefer to be at home rather than manage to find a place for parking. Using buses will certainly be a suitable substitution. Consequently, by visiting others more frequently, their relations will be remarkably improved. In conclusion, due to above mentioned reasons, I suggest that fees for public transportation should be free. I strongly recommend authority trying to improve public vehicles' quality and other factors in order to attract more people to use it."

Vietnamese,"TOEFL iBT vs IELTS Although both TOEFL iBT and Academic IELTS are international tests that assess studentâ€™s English language ability, they differ in many ways. Perhaps the most significant difference is the method used in these exams. Each skill is tested separately in the IELTS. For example, the candidates only need to write essays in the Writing section or answer to several questions in the Speaking part. On the contrary, test takers must combine more than one skill when they respond to TOEFLâ€™s integrated tasks. In these tasks, the students will listen to a conversation or read a passage before they are asked the questions. Second, the ways in which these two tests are conducted are also not alike. The iBT of the title stands for Internet-based Test, which means the candidates have to take the examination through a networked computer. On the other hand, test takersâ€™ response needs transferring to the IELTS answer sheets given at the beginning of each part. Finally, the TOEFL iBT is considered to be about 1 hour longer than the IELTS. Because of these differences, it is advisable to consider these two tests carefully before choosing any of them. --------------- I'm having a difficulty in word choice and collocation. If you have any recommendation, please let me know. Thanks!"

Vietnamese,"The fisrt class of translating subject!!! Every new thing gives us new views . Today, we have the first class of Mr. Doremon(we call our translating teacher Mr. Doremon for some special reasons but no offence) with translating subject. The class was from 3:25pm to 5:00pm. It seemed a long time but we were all so interested in. Our teacher helped us know inside out what translating subject is. It was different from what we had thougt before. He asked us what were the difficulties of this subject. We anwered after discussing together. But it was really surprising because the biggest problem of learning translaing subject was not about the languages that we wanted to translate into, but the ability on using our mother tongue itsefl was remarkable. He explained to us and we all got the point. If we are not good at our mother tongue, the first language that we really need to be fluently, then, the ability of edodmosis languages would be desreased. Now I understand the most important point of learning anything is being good at our origination first. One tree can't be strong if its trunk breaks!!!I get it now, Thank you, Mr. Doremon!!!"

Vietnamese,"How I started learning english. This is my story on when and how I began with English. When I was still a little boy. I hated the school like most of other boys (I supposed, and now I believe :). I will write how I escaped from my preschool and how hard my mother and my first primary teacher made me become a pupil and in the next times. In fact I didn't clearly know why I must go to school but my naughty friends and our interesting break-time's games somehow made me soon realize that school not bad at all. It is a best playground that you only got if do enough learning time in classroom. A bit digressed but I just want to show you that I didn't go to school mainly for study. And it was the same with English. It's 18 year ago. That was my last year in a primary school, English was added into our learning program. I accept new subject by my old attitude that the more fun our playground and our game become, the harder we must deal in classroom. But English might be my and our most favorite just because the new teacher is very young, pretty and nice. You maybe judging me now, but sincerely just because our study time more easy, we could make more noises, do more owner things we like, do more naughty jokes, simply because we didn't fear the new teacher at all. You should know in these day, English is just begun to bring to primary, most of primary English teachers has just graduated, so they was very young. In shortly, I hadn't seriously learned English from the boy-age, the started point."

Non-government has been carrying out many "" saving- our- planet"" program, but their effort has been still much smaller than need.

Vietnamese,"Coffee, coffee...! Does anyone want to have a cup of coffee with me? I feel like I have been poisoned by drinking too much coffee! I drink coffee 3 times a day. One cup in the morning, one cup in the afternoon after lunchtime and one cup at 10pm when I come back home. If I don't drink a cup of coffee in the evening I can't stay awake untill 12pm. First, I drink coffee because I like it. But I have found that I rely on coffee too much. I don't feel good in the morning if I don't drink it. It helps me to feel better, and fresher before I begin working. Now I drink coffee not because I rely on it, but because it has become a habit, it is my regular beverage. If I don't drink coffee I will drink green tea instead (leaf green tea, my family drinks green tea so we always have it at home) I think that I'm a coffee/green tea/caffein addict. I want to get rid of this addiction but right now I can't. Does anyone want to have a cup of coffee with me?"
Vietnamese,"It has recently been announced that a new movie theater may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? ( I'm sutdying Toefl writing by myself, can you help me, thanks :) To some extents, it may be a good news to have a movie theater built in my neighborhood. Nevertheless, I will oppose this plan for some reasons explained below. Firstly, I have to emphasize that a new movie theater will be a good means of civilization. It will bring us more chances to entertain and to get access to a favorable source of knowledge, especially about other cultures, the worldâ€™s history,â€¦. We can also see some hot blockbusters along with some immortal movies. It will encourage us, especially people who are always too lazy to drive a long way to see a two-hour movie. Moreover, with a new movie theater, other services like restaurants, coffee houses,â€¦will find their way to develop and thus, local people can benefit from it. However, there are facts proving that the plan will bring us more disadvantages. There will definitely be heavier traffics and therefore, more traffic jams which have been our nightmare for a while, even without a movie theater. In addition, the opening of a movie theater will lead to the rise of other kinds of entertainment. It can not be denied that local people will benefit from it as it has been said above, but it will undoubtedly distract our children from their studying and may even lead to some social evils, which no consciencous parent could allow. Furthermore, people from other neighborhoods coming to ours may increase the chance of arguments, street fightingâ€¦. With the lack of concerning from the theaterâ€™s owners which usually happens because of their priority for commercial benefit, our neighborhood will lose its secure atmosphere. In conclusion, I will stick to disagree with the plan. There are many ways to help develop a neighborhood without ruining it and the government are responsible to find the best ways."

Vietnamese,"Please help me check errors in my essay about environment. Thank you very much Along with the development of society, more and more problems are brought to our attention, one of which is environmental pollution. To reduced negative affects of pollution, discovering causes and solution of pollution is very important. From my point of view, the main problems taking place in the the Earth which human being is facing are land pollution, air pollution and water pollution. First of all, one of the primary problems is that the air surrounding everyone is polluted. Together with industrial revolution happening through the world, there are many toxic fumes discharged into environment. As a result, It brings about serious natural disasters such as: acid rain, greenhouse effect or global warming. For example, tsunami taking place in Japan in 2011 caused terrible damages as regard wealth and personâ€™s life. Hence, I do believe that the most helpful things we can do to reduce air pollutionâ€™s effects are charging polluting factories high taxes or useing transports with less-polluting engines. Secondly, land pollution is also a serious problems that many countries are experiencing. The most important reason is the destruction of trees. This activity will generate soil erosion and floods which bring about many damages if have a big rain or storm. Therefore, in order to protect forest, governments should plant more trees in blank areas and punish severely everyone distroying forest. Finally, the last thing that must be taken into consideration is water pollution. The main reason is contaminating rivers with harmful chemical. Moreover, the melting of the ice-caps can leads to large floods which are able to sweep dirty substance away. In my opinion, the best way to solve this problems is governments have to execute policies and laws that oblige factories to treat waste water prior to pouring into rivers Once you have known all of these, you must agree with me that many countries in the world are facing negative effects of environmental pollution. Only if they execute specific solutions, the life of people will not be threatened any longer"
Vietnamese,"12 things we should do in a new year For the new year 2010, have you made a plan or a change in order to have a better life yet? Let's start with things below! 1. If you smoke. Let give up. Everyone knows the harm of smoke. If you are not ready and determined, let make a particular plan and call for some help. You will feel energetic and have lack of heart and respiratory problems. 2. Pay attention to your sleeps. Lack of sleeps causes tiredness and weaken your immune. Moreover, it makes your face skin look worse. You will look cheerless and lack of vitality. The best way to have good health and bright eyes is sleeping enough (about 8 to 10 hours per night). If you have insomnia, you should set up a habit of going to sleep on time. You also try not to eat spicy food and coffee at least 3 hours before going to sleep. And do not watch TV one hour before sleeping. 3. Pursue some interests. What were your interests before? Drawing, embroidering, reading or writing? When we are busy, we often forget things that bring happy to us; however, interests are ones which decrease your stress and make you feel more relaxed. So let spend some hours each week to follow your interests, you will see the beauty of life. (to be continued...)"

Moreover, you wanted to learn with the best professors and books, you needed more and more money. By now, you don't need to go oversea, and don't lose money for studying.

This will be useful in the future. When I am free I usually read book. Kinds of book I like is science and information technology.

It just started with a very small thing,but her hot temper and mine made it bigger. She called me to give her a thing,I don't want to and say that ""I'm lazy. You do it yourself"",then she went out of the room angrily with a bad statement,I was angry,and we argued. THe second,my friend have just sent me a message which I had waited for some days. He said that he had suffered a cold,but now seems like he is fine."
Vietnamese,"No title, No.6 I haven't written anything for a long time. I missed Lang-8. I usually go there to read others entries and from reading these entries, I learnt new things about people's relationships, their habits, their opinions... I think reading and understanding is a good way for improving yourself. These days lots of bad things happened (not for me but for my loved people). These things really made me upset. I am the person who have no religion (I am not Buddhistic and aslo not Christan) so when bad things happen I don't blame anyone. But now I have to say that sometimes Buddha and God is so unfair. How can they do that with good people??"
Vietnamese,"Language and culture. If you learn a new language , I believe that you will get much more new knowledges about many things. Itâ€™s not for fun ,It make your life more interesting. Do you agree with me? Iâ€™m a Vietnamese. And I am knew that the way of thinking of Asian is different from the way of thinking of Westerner. There are many different points. Because the way of thinking of Westerner is very broad-minded and liberal but the the way of thinking of Asian is profound and deep . Therefore when they exchanges culture each other or a Westerner live in Asia , sometime they misunderstand each other and make not good impresses. Itâ€™s a pity. For example, Korean like the way to ask a new friends that â€œhow old are you?â€,What is your job?â€ Did you get marriedâ€etc. But Westerner think these questions are impolite. But they donâ€™t know that if Korean ask you those , it means that they are showing interest in you. And for more example,I have just know . Normally ,because of modest of Asian , If I were received praise from anyone that â€œyou speak English very wellâ€ , I will say that â€œno, I donâ€™t speak well, I just speak a littleâ€ . But If I were an American ,I would say â€œthank youâ€. Ok,It is just my story today. May be it is interesting. And I want to learn more ."

Vietnamese,"Games What is game? It is quite hard to find a definite answer. Games should be a part of entertainment or perhaps, in some aspects, we can consider games are the same with entertainment. Their propose is mainly for relaxing ( the first term comes into mind about the word ""game""). But games have more benefits than you may think. Especially, for children, they are on process of forming characters and developing bodies, games also take part in their development. ""Learning also playing"" is proper way for a good health and mind. That's why I want to assure that modern children's games are not good as they should be, at least in comparison with traditional games. I don't know much about that in other countries, but in Vietnam, there are many traditional games and most of them are physical games. As participating in the game, kids must run, chase, jump,... all are physical activities, even like sports! So they are very useful for children's healthy bodies. Active life also protect them from some diseases and strengthen their immunity system. Moreover, almost traditional games require team spirit, because they have to split into two opposite teams to compete to each other, it makes the game interesting and intriguing. They must learn how to corporate into an effective team. Even when play other games, the fact that they gather also create relationships and friendship among them, which is important in forming their personalities. Besides, there are some games help to promote their intelligence, or combine both mental and physical activities. For example, Vietnamese kids play the game that two will spread pebbles into squares arranged by certain order, as long as they can get as many pebbles as possible. This acquires calculation ability. It is clear that these games are more beneficial than computer games kids play today. Sitting one place beside the computer is very passive and harmful for their health, especially for physical health. The matter some kids are too passionate about computer games is very dangerous, when they play throughout days and nights, even without eating or drinking! To sum up, the right game is the game give you interest and the most relaxing, but the most proper and smartest chose is the beneficial one! Playing tradition games is also one way to keep our national tradition. You'll fine excitement in them, I'm sure!"

She is active, friendly, confident and like making others smile but really shy in love. Lane is twenty years old, the age of making date. As other girls, she always looks forward to seeing the prince of her life who is handsome, romantic, faithful and loves her. Are you wondering that she is falling in love with someone? Will you believe if I tell you that in throughout 20 years of her life, she had never loved any guys till one day, her heart was stirred by a man who attracted her at the first sight. Having a part time job at a small foreign restaurent was the begining of her love story. Most of the customers who came the restaurent were foreigners. Lane enjoyed her job so much as the very first experience in her life. One day, there was a man who came to buy some pies. I am not sure how handsome, amazing he was, but for her,he was so amazing and looked so smart. Lane was attracted by him not because of his good-looking face but his sparkle blue eyes and warm smiles made her be moveless at the moment seeing him. She thought an angel was standing in front of her and his smile was like sunshine. The sunshine could make her heart melt. Lane just wannted to look into his eyes for so long. It felt like she was enguflted in passion of a high feeling that she had never had before. Lane was so nervous that she forgot to greet him as other customers. She just said something that even she did not know what it was. Do you wonder what did the man do? Nothing, he just smiled while asking for some pies. But that smile was enough power to made her get red face and be a silly girl who was so different from herself as usual. I think no one could understand how complicated she felt at that time no ecxeption herself. She wished the time stopped turning at once but it was impossible. Lane really wanted to do something to keep him stay longer but she just watched he walk away and the only information she got was he is an English teacher who owns the most beautiful smile that she had ever seen. After that day, she always thought of him and imagined what she would do if she had a chance to see him again. She promised herself she would tell him all her feeling for him or at least, she could have his phone number. Her mind became mixed-up and her heart beat faster anytime she thought about him. She was really falling in love. She wished one day he would take her hand and they walk along the beach together happily. what a feeling!!! I am sorry for my mistakes but please help me correct them, Thank you so much!!!"

And so do I. I will go somewhere and enjoy this day. So far, my country is developing a lot in comparison with it in the past. It is a good thing. However, every matter has two sides. The more we grow, the bigger the distance between us is. In the past, under no circumstances,did they break the national solidarity in the face of danger. They shared each other everything and always sticked together. They were happy because it helped us win any enermies. Now, people live more selfishly and they are not close as they were in the past. They find others hapinesses that are out of communal happinesses. They forget that the connection with the community and sharing happiness theirself helps people grow up. Maybe each member has to have a think back and has a new possitive attitude to make the sociaty better! I love my country and hope it will be much better in the future!

Vietnamese,"My most interesting dream Dreams are the products of our subconscious state of mind. Dreams are of many kinds. But the dream which I had last Saturday was the most interesting I have ever had. I was transported into a fairy land where beautiful fairies were dancing and singing. I dreamt that I had gone to Paris. There I went into night club and saw many exciting happenings. Twist, Ballroom and Shake dances were going on in full swing with the music blaring away. As I was watching the spectacle of dance and drama, a beautiful girl gazed upon me. I was attracted by her rosy cheeks, alluring eyes and sweet smile on her face. I at once recollected the famous poem by Keats known as ""La Belle Dame Sans Merci"". Her silent expressions of love enthralled me. I was really captivated by her charm and sweetness. She was really communicating with me with her silent expressions of love and her eyes. I thought I must respond to her facial and other expressions. I walked up to her, introduced myself and talked to her. She also passed very lovely and witty remarks. We then both took our cup of coffee, while sipping our coffee we had a long talk to our heart's content. At the same time I was remembering and recollecting the eternal lines of Shakespeare: Love is not love that alters When it finds alterations; Or bends with the remover to remove, Now I was in two minds. Whether her love was true or false. But I tried to be true to her. I sincerely expressed my love to her in the most unambiguous terms. We ultimately promised to marry and live as life long companions. Soon the dance and music came to a close. With that she got up and went somewhere, saying that she would be returning soon. But she did not turn up. I was repenting for falling in love. I was thinking that I had been betrayed by this girl who had deceived me. As I was pondering over this heart-stricken subject, my eyes opened but my mind was still groggy. I thought I was in Paris but to my surprise I found myself still in Kuala Lumpur. In this dream I have come across a woman who has been well described by John Keats in his profound poem ""La Belle Dame Sans Merci"" i. e. ""The Beautiful Woman Without Mercy""."
Vietnamese,"13 days in France To improve my english writing skill, I joined to Mylot forum. There are varieties topics for you chatting on this web. I also found out that many people have same interests as I do, such as travelling to French, writing a daily diary or surfing on the net.. I had a bit trouble when I attemped to sign up the forum. It was likely that all the forum's members are American therefore the application form required to fill the zip code of the city where I lived. Surely,I did not have any,I typed randomly 1,2,3,4,5 then I pressed the next button. To my surpise, the code was accepted. It seems that a large number of net citizens choose 12345 as their city zip codes The first topic I made was about the song "" 13 jours en france by Francis Lai"". The song was used as background music for a documentary of The olympic game in Grenobe. It becomes more popular nowaday because it is an OST for the blockbuster Korean Drama "" Winter sonata"". This song also has a special meaning to me because it brings back memories of my old friend. We used to listen the song together, dream about going to paris at once time in our lives. My friend even learned to play it with his guitar. But his dream never came true. He passed away in a car accident five years earlier. Sometimes, I thought I would visit France to fullfill our desires. But there's something stop me. May be,I'm still scared the feeling of lossing him,who is very precious to me."

Vietnamese,"Nuclear technology Since the project in the 1942s of Fermi and Leo Szilard, nuclear technology has been widespreaded and used in many fields. Not long after, Nuclear power is misused as a lethal weapon in World wars so that it produced many serious aftermath with danger to totally destroy the planet but now it has been put to positive use. Some people believe that using such a strong technology can hasten the developing process but others argue that nuclear can initiate the risk of exterminating once again. Now, we will discuss about the benifits and risks associated with nuclear technologyâ€™s use. In the first place, nuclear technology stands out in relief as a special tool in science with many prominent characters. First of all, it is the strongest energy so it can contribute to the tasks not only in life but also in many booming industries. To illustrate, there are so many types of power plants but in effective side, nuclear power plants vanquish the others with very high rate â€Nuclear power plants provided about 14 percents of the world's electricity production in 2007. In total, 16 countries relied on nuclear energy to supply at least one-quarter of their total electricity.â€ (according to nuclear energy institution (nei) ). Besides the use in producing electricity, nuclear medicine technology has already set up a new lucrative type of job in medicine with rising trend and Employment of nuclear medicine technologists is expected to increase by 15 percent from 2006 to 2016 ( www. bls. gov ). Moreover, nuclear technology is a method of reducing pollution. Using nuclear means that we can reduce some toxic gases and in fact, there is a large amount of harmful gases emissions avoided by the U. S. nuclear industry such as in 1995, sulfur dioxide is 4.19 million short tons but in 2008, it is 2.65 millions short tons; nitrogen oxides is 2.03 in 1995 but 0.91 in 2008. For these reasons, nuclear technology not only develops our economy but also our health. Nevertheless, I have to grant that it has caused some seemingly serious problems. To start with, the nuclear industries discharge a little quantity of low-level radioactive waste and high-level radioactive. These things can give us some diseases and other small problems. Apart from that, with even the smallest mistakes, nuclear industries can cause many serious consequences. The nuclear explosion from nuclear factories can bequeath many after-effects. The poisonous radioactive substances leak out through the mistakes from process of handling waste. These substances soak into the soil and not only spoil the soil but also affect the animals and plants in the neighborhood. It not only has the temporary effects but also has bad influences to the future generation. Because of that, it is also sensible to say that nuclear technology can cause risks. To sum up, most of problems are two-sided affairs that they have benifits and disadvantages. However, in this case, with the development of science, avoiding the risk cannot be a difficult task and benifits of nuclear technology can be more and more developed. Consequently, benefits can prevail the risks."

Vietnamese,"MISERY IS NEEDED People may find many ways to avoid misery, but sometimes you must think outside the box, accept it as an essential part of seeing the good and beautiful sides of it. First of all, misery is like the dark flavor in chocolate, itâ€™s essential and with sweetness it completes life. For example, sometimes you have to sacrifice for your love, even if it causes you sadness and depression, because it also makes you happy because you are doing something worthy. Secondly, after suffering from misery, people will become stronger, more resolute and more independent so they can have a great energy and attitude to achieve their goals. Case in point, you thought falling apart from your love was the end of the world. On the other hand, when time passed by you knew all the tears you cried, all the sacrifices and all the dramas were worthy, because they made you have the strength you now have, to turn pain to passion and overcome every challenge in your life. In conclusion, no matter how people try to avoid misery, it is always there as a part of our life. Instead of obliterating it, we should perceive it and make it useful."
Vietnamese,"graphic designer Graphic designer is a kind of artist but has many differences with primary one who just uses ordinary techniques as carving or painting, does without any advanced technology to create works. Graphic designers who have to be competent in drawing and they are also capable to use adeptly many programs or applications on the computer to feel free and figure out their ideas. Many people dream up these designers getting qualifications to be blended the clever character of engineer with the sensitive artist. Today most of graphic designers usually cling to the computer and a few machines as camera, printer and scanner. Since early of the 20th century, graphic designers commenced to become an important role for the development of commodity industry and commerce in many industrialization countries. A colossal category of jobs is covered by them, consisting of advertising, book design, branding, illustration, page layout, typography, multimedia and web media. The elements of typography, image and color are always classified and using correctly to show ideas of the designers. Especially, color is often the most important part, choosing the wrong color can be a â€œcalamityâ€ for their works so designers are always cautious to select the colors. They always feel like to coax people or clients by their great ideas that are based on beautiful images of design. You can realize easily many ordinary products from creators. For instance: Many foreign people always see a logo which is easy as pie with the fresh red color named â€œVietnam â€“ the hidden charmâ€ on the plane or travel magazines and brochures when they come to visit Vietnam. This logo is a symbol for Vietnam traveling. Newspapers, magazines or logos that are made by graphic designers. Graphic Design has appeared in Vietnam for 40 years ago, but it falls behind and even itâ€™s a far cry from some countries in Southeast Asia as Thailand, Indonesia, Philippine and Singapore. There are many reasons for this but the main reason is slow to apply new technologies day in and day out. At the present day, many art universities in Vietnam celebrate long courses or short terms about graphic design major for students but the teaching of applying technology is still few and far between so after graduation, students often do not feel up to find a good position of this occupation. If anyone wants to become a professional, they have to do over to register other training courses in abroad."

Vietnamese,"Scientific love I depict the show, again. This time, scientists continued another experiment. Based on scientific theories, they divined results of a speed-dating among 20 men and women. Unfairly, one woman was chosen in preliminary stage. She would received help from scientists to make her more attractive ( scientifically, of course). This way, they used making up technology to hide her drawbacks and a fashion specialist make her body like that of a model. According to theories, men are attracted by who has the similar face. Men attended the experiment also took a psychological test . Result of the test would be used to sort them into different groups. Men and women had the same result were predicted to be attractive to each other. The speed-dating conducted as usual. The result was quite surprising: scientists seemed to be not good matchmakers. Their meticulous preparation didn't give the girl more chances to have more boyfriends. The man who scientists supposed to be the most compatible with her turned out to date with another, although he liked her at first. Scientists' conjecture about other possible couples were wrong, too. There were only 2 cases successful. So, human is more complicated, and love is still mysterious far beyond science. It belongs to mental life and makes our lives more romantic, doesn't it?"

Vietnamese,"Reply to a person who corrected my text. Thanks for your correcting. I certainly will achieve fluency in English soon. I think listening constantly to understandable materials will turn out fluency. Do you know Khatzumoto, I think if you want to learn Japanese, his website will give you more information that you need. But beside, you should read other websites on how to learn languages such as How to learn any language. There's a vast number of these sites out there. Good luck with your Japanese learning. After fluent in English, I will go on Japanese with the method names LIstening-Reading (you can check out it here http://learnanylanguage.wikia.com/wiki/Listening-Reading_Method). Plus I found some people could get fluent in their target languages by watching TV (This is extremely interesting). And many many other methods, you should check as well. I think it will cause you overwhelming at first, but I hope everything will be alright, I'm now stressful as well. (Please care for my mistakes in this text, Thanks)"
Vietnamese,"Going around the city center just for a cheap piggy bank! In the society with the slippage in prices, people trend to save money as possible, especially students. My friend is not an exception. Today she asked me to help her buy a piggy bank because she knew I was planning to go to the market. I went out at 8:00am, and decided to buy for her a clay pig first and then i would go to buy something for me . I had never bought it before so I did not know where I should go to get it. I thought bookstores would have clay pigs. I was right, there were many beautiful clay pigs there. I chose one of the them, picked it up. Oh my God, It costed 80 thoundsand Vietnam Dong. I could not believe that a clay pig was too expensive like that. I was not sure buy it for my friend because I knew she would be shocked too, then I called her to ask. She told me that I should not buy it in bookstores because the price would be much more expensive. Then, I found piggy bank in many shops and they did not sell piggy banks. It was sunny and I felt abit tired. Finally, I came to a small shop on the last street. Luckily, I found it, a quite cute pig with a cheap price, just 10 thoundsand Vietnam Dong. The time was 10:45 am. It took nearly 2 hours to get a cheap clay pig. I came back home and did not buy anything for me. However, now I know where I should go if I wanna get a cheap piggy bank! Thank you for reading!"
Vietnamese,"Alone in the bus How to cope with being alone in a bus? Until now I've been co confortable with sleeping, listing to radio or music when I was alone in bus. But today I felt so boring . I mean, there are the driver an other customers of course, but you can't just say ""Hi"" and talk to them, righ? When I was going through the park for my bus with my empty stomach ( my stomach became empty quickly because after the fight between my dentist and my lower left wisdom tooth - of course he won - I can eat rice soup only) after my English class, I saw people running, jogging or exercising or kicking shuttlecock.

Vietnamese,"What r u going to do next? I dunno how to be fluent in English faster then the speed of now, but I decided to continue to find the way. There's a vast amount of methods out there, and u know, what we have to do is choose one and optimize it to fit us. But I don't find it will work, WHY? Because we will never stop finding, we will never think our current method is the best one, or at least, the one which suits us best. I have read a vast amount of articles on how to learn a language effectively, from Spanish to Japanese, from the famous one such as French to some other one such as Catalog (I don't know anything about this language, don't know who speaks them, don't know where this language is spoken). And to be honest, all of the achievement of those who mastered them is amazing. Many of them reached fluency under 1 year, some only in 8 weeks, and many other one we have to be surprised to know. Anyway, I have to admit that I haven't reached fluency in English yet,we learn it everyday, all day, all time (all English all the time, huh), but what happened, over 3 months of intense study, we don't see much improvements, why, whether it would be our method, NO, we are using the best method we know, from the best foreign language learners, then WHY, I don't know, I suppose that we're wasting the most of time, I mean we don't use if effectively. In my thought, if we have a day job or going to school everyday, we maybe even learn English faster. Maybe, I only think maybe.... We only have 12 months for reaching fluent in 2 languages, it's not a commanding goal, but only if we use the right method, and use time effectively. As I said, I will continue to research on how to learn language but it's only the second priority, I will stick to our current learning method, or at least, doing at least 2 hours a day for listening and the same time for reading. Good luck with your English learning, my buddy."
Vietnamese,"Maybe it's not LOVE. Well, maybe that's not love. Maybe I just misunderstood something. Maybe I didn't have a boyfriend he's my closest boyfriend.

The quality of goods is too bad for us to accept the delivered goods The price of our share increases about by 5% every year, This is the first visit of me to London Thank you to the letter on 20, may, which offer me to accept the chief accountant in your company. If the customers pay within 30 days, they will save much money. I think we should decrease prices for students, because they donâ€™t have much money We not only export goods and services but also high-degree experts to the developing countries If you accept this job, you will get high salary. Iâ€™m afraid that we canâ€™t buy this computer because it is too expensive. Please research this contract carefully before signing. All types of advertising have a common objective that helps the manufactures sell more goods. Besides, advertising also provides necessary information to consumers. The bank for investment and development increases lending interest from 7.75% to 8.25% per year. If the company earns more profits, the dividend of it will be higher.

Not like shareholders, bondholders are not proprietors of a business. They are creditors of it. Income tax is the tax that government imposes on income of individuals and business firms. Taxes on private incomes and corporation profits are main revenues of almost the industries countries, they also play more and more important role in tax system of the developing countries. When individuals or companies buy shares of a company, they will receive stock certificates indicate the number of shares they hold For exporting and importing goods, it needs a system of international foreign exchange. Currently, almost foreign currencies are exchanged by the floating exchange rate. Sometimes, the big fluctuations of exchange rate may threaten the stability of the economy. The extent of a country is determined by aggregation of goods and services that it creates. Fiscal policy that ministry of Finance implements can be broken down by 2 parts: government expenditure and taxation."

Vietnamese,"Music for life Music! Music is as old as the Earth. I suppose music appeared almost simultaneously with humankind. We take music for granted, music is familiar to us like breath. Music came to our life easily and simply. There was no need of any musician, or any singer, ancestors sang and created songs as they were sharing their emotions and their thoughts. As they were working on fields, rowing,..., they sang to energised their laboring spirit. At nights, when people sat around, songs brought community together. Therefore,as you can see today, ancient songs depict lives clearly. Nowadays, in modern civilization, music is still essential for life. Music now is not only tool to express emotions, thoughts, but also part of entertainment industry. Globalisation has deep influence on the way people enjoy music today. Instead of traditional songs, instead of listening music from CDs, radio, and live performance, modern generation heard music mainly from Internet, or what we ususally call digital music. This give some advantages: for example, music is wider spread, because listening music on the Internet is much more cheaper and easier than buying a CDs, waiting for hours a favourite song on the radio, even waiting for years to enjoy a live performance! Especially, that means people from far far countries have more chances to hear modern music. Moreover, keeping traditional songs is easier by recording them. But music industry itself protest digital music. Because, while digital music covers the world, that doesn't mean they sell more or get more. Easier way to approach music makes people hardly buy a CD, except for special occasions, such as for presents, gifts, rewards,..."

Teacher in university don't care about it anymore. They don't attend too much to what the student's doing, and that why some student have chance to eat and sleep in the class.

Especially a story happened in 11th grade class. I donâ€™t remember clearly but that day, in playtime we played a game and won. Winner could have a request and loser must do it. But at that time, I havenâ€™t thought of any request yet when playtime time was up. Next subject was geography. I didnâ€™t learn lesson by heart but I didnâ€™t feel scare because I thought early in school year, maybe my teacher didnâ€™t test old lesson. She was a new gentle teacher in my school. So I was very surprise when she called my name. I knew if I recited lesson, perhaps I would have a bad mark. But I remembered I won that game a moment ago. So I said Thu- loser, replaced me and recited lesson. Luckily, she has learned this lesson by heart and she agreed. My teacher still hasnâ€™t remembered our name and face so she didnâ€™t realize Thu recited lesson, not me. That day, Thu recited very well and she got 9 mark. And of course, my teacher wrote 9 mark with my name. At first I was afraid she could discover but we studyed geography only once a week so up to the end of school year she didnâ€™t know this story."

But I suppose they are just too worried and they even have short term vision. Human kind is going along with technological revolution, our life has been changing so much at record pace rare one can imagine. It is said that computers first, and then the internet are big discoveries which have influenced so many people and so strongly like that. It changes our life totally! Perhaps no one 20 years before had such imagine that computers cover day life as today. So, it is unreasonable to prevent our children from using such a huge step of mankind development. Adversely, we should let them use computers as soon as possible, just from simple activities."

All activities will be shown on HTV (Hochiminh television) and Binhphuoc television, and also reported in Tuoitre and Thanhnien newspaper. I intend to contact with Mr. Toan.

I am really exhausted now. My class had a plan to get together tonight, but I did not feel like, so I decided to just go around the beach by my own to have some fresh air. I went to the beach with a pair of flip-flops. Sea water make my feet wet, sand blew in my feet, then, each toe. I let everything out of my mind. There were not many people on the beach even today is weekend. I liked that because I would not see couples who were falling in love and they were hand in hand, shoulders by shoulders. Unluckily, after few minutes, It started raining, I came back home, I was wet completely when I got home. My throat hurts now, today I don't sing to follow the singers like everyday. I even don't like sitting. I won't do anything or study anything today. I feel so lonely now, I have many friends but still feel so odd here. Do they think about me when they are playing together there? Why don't they call me or send a message? I don't know why but It hurts me, I wanna cry, I really wanna cry out loud like kids when they want others pay attention on them. If I cried, would run to me and comfort me?

Vietnamese,"Good job with good salary in big international company or interesting job with lower salary in a local company? Last month I and some friends at university went to a job interview at a Germany company. In fact, when we were called for the job interview, we weren't told which position they were recruiting. However, as our major is Japanese studies, it's likely translator or interpreter position. As the news came rather close (we were informed about the recruitment just 2 days before the interview) I had hardly any time to prepare and was extremely nervous coming to the interview. My Japanese is not very good and it's been quite a while since the last time I spoke English. I thought I hadn't done well with either my interview or my ability test. But 2 weeks later, they called me and said that they want to take me for the internship during which they will observe and see whether I am qualified for the position in their company. The internship will start from July, after my graduation from university. However, to be honest, despite the fact that this company is a famous one and they may offer me good salary and good working environment in the future, it's not in the field which I have interest in. I love culture and traveling, and I always want to work as a tourism manager in a good tourism agency. However, it might be a more difficult way for me to get close to my closest target: becoming rich and helping my parents out, buying our very first house and giving them the chance to travel abroad to dream lands. It's difficult decision but I think I have to do well in my internship so that I can get the job first. After that, I will consider my interest and future."

James attained 5 prizes from the World Press Competition and he is going to attain more and more greater achievements. In 2006, he was injured in Afghanistan. After 3 surgeries, he had to spent 2 years to recover his health. In 2008, he came back with the photography project named â€œInfernoâ€. This project consists of many pictures, these images depict about victims of war and it was acclaimed by colleagues all over the world at that time. All of the images in this project were published in many famous newspapers, magazines. In 2009, an American publisher received to produce the book named â€œWar Photographyâ€. Everyone is astonished by his works, many people have never seen any similar scenes before. His aggregate pictures are authentic evidences to admonish everybody of the consequences from war. Many people were killed, many children were abandoned, many cities become empty places. Especially, the conflict or civil war is aggravating the situation in some poor countries.

In an interview, he said that: â€œAbove all, this job is not a breeze, it is a real arduous job, if you want to become a war photographer, you have to adapt quickly with the dangerous circumstances filled by acrid smoke, messy voices, guns and abrupt injuries, add up to anticipate any trouble in a strange country because sometimes you can not bank on supports to solve your problems and you must be always at ease. As a matter of fact, war photographers often are apt to be single because they never want anybody to get anxious thoughts for their life and they also have an austere way of lifeâ€¦â€ And he was asked â€œWhatâ€™s the most terrible thing in your job?â€ James answered that: â€œMy camera is broken down all at onceâ€"

Mandarin,"The Developing Country As we konw, China is a developing country. When I came to my hometown--Yangzhou city yesterday, I was convinced that it is very true because the city has changed a lot over last several years. Yangzhou locates in the southeast China and is beside the Yangzi River. Althouth it is a small and time-honoured city, Yangzhou is becoming more and more flourishing and vigorous. An industrail park has been built just beside the old town and many high tech companies are booming in the park. With income incresing rapidly, local citizens who were used to riding bicycles have changed to driving cars. Restaurants, shopping malls and a variety of stores are springing up all over the city. When people realize that they can develop careers in small cities, large cities like Beijing and Shanghai may relieve some burdern."

Mandarin,"Test for National Civil Servants In recent years, there are more and more people who have participated in the test for national civil servants. Millions of students choose civil servant as their most ideal occupation after graduation. And among them, the high-educated, like masters and doctors, take quite a large percentage. The craze in civil servant test has attracted widespread attention. The following reasons can account for this kind of craze. Above all, nowadays college students face great employment pressure. Civil servant, as one of the most stable professions in todayâ€™s China, becomes their preferable choice. Moreover, in recent years, the welfare and salary of civil servants have been improved greatly, which undoubtedly attracts many people. Besides, the high social position of civil servants is an important factor drawing many people to take part in the civil servant test. In my opinion, this craze in civil servant test will continue in the following years. However, from the long run, it doesnâ€™t do good to the development of the nation. If most high quality talents gather in the government departments, it might lead to a waste of resources. Therefore, both the individuals and the government should have a more objective recognition of the civil servant test craze"

I wish next time if i have appointment with my friends the weather will be very good. So today I just stay home to play computer and watch movie. I think the movie that i watch is terrible. It is just like rubbish. I can't believe the movie's director is very famous all around the world. However I feel happy to write these on lang-8

Mandarin,"GLEE help me get out of the shadow I am a loser. Because my ugly appearance, I was bullied by other kids, especially the boys. They laughed at me, and throw twigs and dirt to me, that made me developed a great inferiority complex. Now I know that complain is not useful at all, what I should do is work hard, don't waste time on complaining. In the pass years I waste too much time, I can't contiune do that. I care too much about how others think of me. Due to my poor English level, I couldn't express clearly. GLEE help me get out of the shadow. Although I am ugly and stupid, I can'y give up myself. It's not late to try hard to achieve my dream. So that, even though I am already junior student, and have so poor foundation on English, I decide to learn TOFEL. I am major in biotechnology, I wish I can go abroad to study. My classmate told me that I have no hope because my English is poor and I am not clever at all, and the university I attend is not a good university in China. But I will regret if I didn't try hard to learn when I was young. I still have chance to change myself, even though I use so much ""I"" when I write. By the way, today is April 1st, but my words is true~"
Mandarin,"The first calender Future historise will be in a unique position when they come to record the history of our own times they will hardly know which facts to select from the great mass of evidence that steadily accumulates . what is more ,they will not have to relysolely on the written word . Films ,videos ,cds and cd-roms are just some of the bewildering amount of information they will have . they will be able ,as it were ,to see and hear us in ation . but the historian attempting to reconstruct the diatant past is always faced with a difficult task . he has to deduce what he can from the few scanty clues availale . even seemingly insigificant remains can shed interesting light on the histoty of early man ."

Mandarin,"Want to find someone to learn in pairs- English/Chinese I'm a newcomer to this site. It's a good idea to learn from each other's languages. But the fact that Lang-8 had post all entries with the same 'Language Flag' all together makes the entries chaotic. I think it would be better to have an option just displaying the entries that match your language. I mean, for example, I want to improve English, so it would be better to just show the entries written in Chinese by native English speaker, thereby we can easily find each other to learn from. Do you agree?"
Mandarin,"these days I feel so tried,I had to finish my homework,but I think it's all right that I can finish my homework at the end of this holiday. but my parents didn't,think so ,they think I finish my work and I will learn something else. Hu...... so many work,how long can I finish it???!!!"

Mandarin,"The Developing Story I mentioned in my journal yesterday that the table salt had been sold out in many large cities in China. It sounds very impossible but it did happen. Just like runing on a bank, the stock of salt would been exhausted quickly if large numbers of people suddently pour into stores to purchase as much as they can. The good news is that the crisis is coming to an end because the government has promised to provide engough salt to meet market demand. It is funy that many customers begin to go back to refund money. The apparent cause of the event is that the nuclear crisis in Japan has really scared people and they don't know how to deal with it. However, when I heard that the stock price of some listed companies whose businesses are related to salt or iodine went up rapidly in last two days but slumped today, I began to understand why such weird things took place here. It is very likely that somebody has spred out the rumor and used people's panic to make money. I think it would be a big shame for the stock maket's supervisor if my guess is true."

Although it didn't realate to my majoy, I still came to watch it, may be it also benefited tome for learning English. In the competition,I appreciated their performances, but, I also found some questions in it. Firstly, some students had a non-clear pronounce to make a speech, may be they were nervous. Scondly, some students didn't make stage well. Finally, some students didn't control the time well. But anyway,they have tried their best to do it. In fact, I thought that some part of competition was hard for them. And include me. So, when I wame back my dormitory I thought much. How did I improved my English?

Mandarin,"Back Again It's been a long time since I last loged in Lang-8, life got tough after back to school as a practice teacher in Dangtu, a small county in Ma'anshan,Anhui Province. Our teaching team consisted of 10 people, we've got a great time there. It was wonderful to be with the students, and time passed quickly while teaching, and I finally found the job that suited me best, being a teacher. These weeks we've got a assignment in writing class, to write a narrative story, which includes 15 historical facts in it. I am going to write the Pearl Harbor Attack, in the pespective of a Japanese soldier. It's hard to find the materials that I need, since most of the materials are wrote by the Americans. It is hard for me to image the Japanese's feeling about the attact or even the WWâ…¡. The protangoist in my story is called Tanaka, a 30 year-old man from a village in Hiroshima, he has been involved in the war for 8 years and misses his family very much and tired the killing.

In the queue people spoke seldom, and I noticed two young boys with hip-hop clothes and serious expression who queued quietly. Suddenly I felt my heart swell with a courage and firmness. I knew there was nothing we could fear. Life is importantï¼Œbut there have some other things more important than it. What you feared and why should you fear? Donâ€™t let the difficulty overpower you. At first I felt like I became more mature, and I had responsibility to take good care of my parents."

Mandarin,"In the oncologic surgery ward of an inpatient department (2) Today 'The Broadcast Station' man[*] felt nausea. Nausea is a common side effect appearing during the chemotherapy. The drugs make the patients feel sick and lose appetites, when their need most are foods. It's reported that many cancer patients don't die of the disease itself, but of the innutrition caused by the therapies. â€™The Tigressâ€˜[**] seemed very worried about her husband's condition. The congee and the roast fish she brought became a mission impossible to him. He tasted only a little bit then refused to eat more. But don't forget that a tigress is a tigress. No means nothing to her. It's just a piece of cake for her to 'persuaded' her husband to put the rest food in his mouth. However, it's not an easy task to stop him vomiting after 30 minutes,even for 'The Tigress'. When the terrible vomiting finally stopped, the man started to murmur things like his wife shouldn't force him to eat that much. The Tigress refuted his argument and provided an alternative explanation. She argued with confidence that this was all because he ate too fast. Then she recalled that she had faced much worse situation but still manage to eat enough food. 'Chemotherapy is nothing.' she said,'You should feel lucky you are not pregnant. When I carried your daughter, I felt so much worse. I vomited as soon as I opened my eyes in the morning. But then I still ate. Then I vomited again. Then I ate again. Then I vomited again... ' At the end, the man admitted that he was just not tough enough and he should definitely learn from his beloved wife. After that, he was allowed to sleep. Of course, he ate some more congee before that. The Tigress won the battle as always. Booyah! [*][**] If you don't know who is 'The Broadcast Station' and who is 'The Tigress', please see my diary 'In the oncologic surgery ward of an inpatient department (1)'."

But at last, while we were walking by a store, there was a man talked with us. He asked us ,""Is there a KFC here?""

Mandarin,"Working or Travelling Before University It's not uncommon for some students to get some work experience or travel for a year before going further studies in university. In this essay I would like to explore both negative and positive effects of this phenomenon. The benefits obtained from working and travelling before university are obvious. Nowadays, the tuition of tertiary education can really cost a fortune, which force some students to work for a period in order to relieve their parents' economic burden. Also, since the ultimate purpose of education is employment, it's necessary for students to get a rudimentary grasp of what skills are required in work, this can only be achieved by previous working experience. Regarding travel, it's definitely a great opportunity of releasing study loads, providing moments of peace, expanding visions. Nevertheless, many argue that postponing studies would take away precious periods for studying. After a year without studies, many youngsters would find themselves somewhat a bit difficult to catch up with complicated university lessons. Moreover, despite being employed, students in high school degree have insufficient competence perform well in work, which turn out to make them lose assertiveness. Besides, a large amount of money is required when it comes to travel, the cost of travelling is beyond many students' reach. More importantly, young people often lake a strong awareness of self-protection, thus it's hard to ensure their security during working or travelling processes. What I mentioned above are but few pros and cons of working or travelling before university, students need to outline specific plans according to their own conditions."
Mandarin,"We are friends indeed. In our life,there always exists someone we can turn to pouring out our soul when we are in bad mood.

Mandarin,"About Lang-8 I heard the earning of this service per a month is mere about 100,000 yen (10,000 US dollars). Lang-8 is one of the most useful services on the web for world people. However, it is very difficult for this service to succeed in business. So I want to be a premium member for supporting this service, but here is a problem. I don't want to use my credit cards on the web for security. So I want to use ""web money"" which we can charge money in convenience stores. However we can use as instrument of payment for this service only credit cards and Yahoo wallet (a payment service of Yahoo! Japan). Yahoo wallet can be charged money only by credit cards. There are many people who can't have credit cards in the world, of course in Japan too. For example, teen agers can't have credit cards because they are not adults. In Japan, such many freelance workers as writers, cartoonists, and actors can't often pass the screening by credit cards companies because their incomes are irregular. Using only credit cards and Yahoo wallet as a payment tool is omitting such people from this service from this service's premium members, in fact. I am very thanking to the creators of this site. However, I hope that they take more universal tools for payment."
Mandarin,"a long vacation is better Instead of take several short vacations, I would like to take a long vacation each year. A long vocation not only makes me completely relaxed, but also provides a chance for me to plan a long journey around the country, even travels abroad.

Mandarin,"gloomy Sunday Last weekend I planed to spend one day at University to finish parts of my project. But(I hate this word) yeah,you probably guessed it right. I didn't do that instead of staying at home. Some time I was depressed at weekend totally, especially at Sunday, to me, I don't like Sunday at all. It's started when I was in high school a boarding school which mean I will live in school for whole week then go home for weekend.

Mandarin,"Money Tuesday June 21, 2009 Sunny Iâ€™m engaged in IELTS writing today. So Iâ€™ll write a topic about it everyday if possible. I hope and I guess Iâ€™m not along. So I will post my article on Lang-8 if I write one. If thereâ€™s anyone who can revise my article, Iâ€™ll really appreciate it. Todayâ€™s topic isï¼Œ Many people think that the government should spend the large amount of money in channeling into artistic and cultural projects on basic infrastructure projects instead. Do you agree or disagree? And here is my answer. Indeed, there are many basic infrastructures are needed to be build now, and the past and the future. They are always needed. But shall we spend the money for artistic and cultural projects in them? For me, I prefer not spend these money which is ordinary suppose to be used for cultural construction. Basic infrastructures are important, but itâ€™s not everything in our life. The capacity of a cask is determined by its shortest wooden board. Basic infrastructure should not be the shortest board of our society, so does art and culture. Of course, basic infrastructures are important, and they are badly lack in many parts of China. But I think we should not, and in reality, we didnâ€™t pay all the money for basic infrastructures. Why? In my own case, for instance, I can stand for living in a place which is not so good on material conditions, but it would be intolerable for me to live in a place without some book to read. Are you willing to live in a world with no books to read, no music to listen and no paintings to admire, though thereâ€™s every material you want? I canâ€™t imagine how this kind world would be like and this is the world would like if we spend all the money in basic infrastructures and no money in art and culture. In the one hand, art and culture is needed for a high quality life, in the other hand, basic infrastructures are needed in many place. If we want to improve our life quality, obviously, we need to make a balance between material and spirit. Basic infrastructures are truly important, yet in the same time, with the improvement of material, we also need an improvement in art and culture. As the saying goes, we eat for life, not live for eat, similarly, whatâ€™s our purpose to spend money in basic infrastructures and art and culture? For me, I get the feeling that we spend this money to make us feel our life is happy and meaningful. For this purpose, shall we spend all the money in basic infrastructures? Precisely, a person without â€œspirit foodâ€ would not be happy, and who will think his or her life is meaningful without great spirit? All in all, we need to make a balance between art and culture and basic infrastructure. I would prefer to make more money to spend on basic infrastructure, not simply cut down the money on art and culture and spend them on basic infrastructure. All right, I finally finished. I hope you can give me some suggestion in revising or rewriting this article. Thank you for you reading and if you do give me some suggestion, Iâ€™ll really appreciate it. Thank you once again.

Mandarin,"Take Pros and Cons Of College Student's Taking Part_time Jobs Nowadays many college students take part_jobs in their spare time. It is no doubt that taking a part_time job can bring about several benefits to college students. Above all,part_time jobs provide students a valuable chance to put their knowledge into pratice,which can improve their greatly. Furthermore,through taking part_time jobs can make they contact with many kinds of people in the campus or society,which is significant for them to get more experience about how to communicate greatly with others and is also benefit for the later work and study. In addtion,students can get some money to release the pressure on their families(to help lighten the burden on their families.) However,as every coin has two sides,taking part_time jobs have also some disadvantages. For one thing,some students spent so much time on the part_time jobs that neglect their study. What's worse,students may be cheated or hurt by their employers for lack of enough experience. weighing the pros and cons,I think college students can take some part_time jobs whether in the campus or in society. Undoubtedly,we can know the society more from the part_time jobs. But it is worth nothing that we cannot spent much time on it but influence our study. To conlude,if the spare time is enough,it is better for us to step out of campus and take some part_time jobs."

Mandarin,"Tough Period Everytime it hits the end of a semester of Architecture, things get tough. For now, I haven't slept for two days and three nights, struggling with my project, which is due in a couple of days. Sometimes I was just wondering whether I'd got a good timing. I've heard that people can make it through their tough work even with 8 hours long sleeping time and extra time for playing games and stuff. I do have realized that architecture is quite different from the others. It requires some sort of ALL-ROUNDEDNESS, which has been mentioned by our lecturer a few times. Therefore, it requires the students to sort out a better schedule on things. Besides, according to our lecturer, architecture is one of the courses that require students to read as mcuh as possible. Broadening our horizons enriches our minds, thus enriches our design. However, my biggest problem has always been about improving my English. Without a good knowledge of English, without a rich English vocabulary, how am I to read more books? In an essay test a few days ago, I scored 12.5 marks out of 20, which was truly irritating. My lecturere told me that my essay was like translated straight from Chinese, which was not concise enough. Besides, my essay contained too much informal grammar. Yes, that's what I've been feeling for myself too. But as a matter of fact, that derived from my pevious way of learning English when I was still in China. Anyway, I'm learning a language in a rational way. In other words, when I hear the word ""bus"", the first thing pop out in my mind should be an image of a real bus, instead of either the pronunciation or the three letters ""b"" ""u"" ""s"" or the Chinese meaning ""è½¦"". That's my own way of ensuring that a certain word has sticked to my mind. But so far, this hasn't exactly happened to me. Well, a bit off the track. Life alone in a foreign country is truly hard. Luckily, I've got dream, and that's what keeps me on for long. I hope that I can lay my own landmarks on earth some day in future. Cheers! To myself! And to all of our kind who are fighting hard for their future."

Several days ago, I came across Chrometa by accident and had a go with it. Now, I find it's really useful, so I'd like to introduce it to my friends. This software can automatically watch what you are doing while you use your computer. After a day's work, you can view what you have done and how long you spent on each item. For example, I can find out how long I've used chrome, how long I've coded, etc, even how long I've took to write this entry. This information is really useful for us, because we can figure out where time is wasted and avoid it in the future. The only shortcoming of this software I've found out is that this software will store users' information online. So I'm a little worried about the safety of my private information. If this software could store information in one's personal computer, it will be perfect! If you guys know similar software that don't store information online, could you recommend to me?"

Mandarin,"WikiLeaks WikiLeaks created a diplomatic uproar after the website began releasing classified documents. The action taken by WikiLeaks gives many more people access to secret--abnormal diplomatic activity. For example,to obtain a wide variety of information about something or ask somebody to provide a intelligence information. Though some officials criticed that the release of those documents may create a hostile environment,then diplomats and soldiers will become at risk. So some barriers to sharing information is necessary,shouldn't sharing across the board. Those who need it could get it,who don't need it,don't get it. But i personally disagree with that,some monitoring of illeagal activity could reveal wether the system's being misused. It is a matter of transparency,so that may include citizens. People should have rights in confidence express their own views. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0lHsIiiL_8"
Mandarin,"Jogging I like running in clean air and large space. This term I go out for jogging 2 or 4 times per week. Several classmates may together with me sometimes. But I prefer to run alone.

Usually I jogging in a park near my school. The scene is good,Some old men take the air on the lawn,there are many children fly a kite. Generally,I feel comfortable there. So it is a good place to jogging much better than the dusty and crowded playground in my school."

Mandarin,"Should we put shops, schools, offices and homes in certain areas? In many cities, planners tend to put shops, schools, offices and homes in certain areas. To what extent do you think the advantages of this practice outweigh the disadvantages? As the explosion of the population, how to design the layout of a city has become to a serious topic. Some planers claim that shops, schools, offices and homes should been placed in particular areas to make city orderly. While another sound insists that these houses should be built randomly at the initial. In my point of view, I believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages in this practice. We have to admit that orderly layout can make a city looks more confortable, and sometimes, it would bring more convenience to one's daily life. For example, when people get some emergencies, they would definitely know where to go and how to get there in a very short time. And more than that, if we put all the stores together, customers do not have to drive around to choose the products they need to buy, which would save a lot of time. However, the disadvantages of this practice, which cannot be ignored, are still exist. Specifically, assume we build all the homes together in a certain area, it is predictable that traffic jam would happen every working day, people drive home in a same crowed way. Moreover, it must contain more than one hospital or school in one city. It is unfair to build schools or hospitals in a certain part area of city to those people who lived far from these public places, which is the same for stores and offices. Overall, I do not support the viewpoint of putting variety of houses in certain areas, the benefits will not achieve the planner's initially expect. The disadvantages are far more than the advantages brought from this practice."

Mandarin,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: teachers should be paid according to how well their students perform. In this knowledge-booming era, more people accept education now than those did before, that is to say, teachers play important roles in developing studentsâ€™ knowledge and behaviors. How to judge teachersâ€™ salary is proper or not? I totally can not consent the statement that teachersâ€™ salary depends on how well their students perform. Here is why. First of all, it is unjust for teachers to judge teachersâ€™ salary is according to their studentsâ€™ performance. Many critical factors beyond classrooms, such as studentsâ€™ family and friends, have great impact on studentsâ€™ behaviors and learning efficiency. It is necessary to take into account other influence that may affect studentsâ€™ performance. Accordingly, teachers should not completely account for performance of students. Second, teachers were paid according to how well their students perform, prompting a counterproductive influence on students. In order to earn better salary, teachers would enforce students to study extremely hard and push them to perform well under strictly regulation and punishment. As a result, students feel too stressful and frustrated to go to school with happiness, causing negative impact on studentsâ€™ behavior reversely. Finally, how to measure studentsâ€™ performance is a quiet difficult problem. Are students who get great grades good students? Or do those who are polite and of integrity perform well? There is no standard answer because teachers have their own criteria to judging how well their students perform. Therefore, it is not easy to develop a just and persuasive salary system to decide teachersâ€™ earning. To conclusion, although someone claims that teachers would teach their students better if their salary were consistent with their studentsâ€™ performance, the drawbacks of this means clearly outweigh its upsides. In my opinion, judging teachersâ€™ salary should consider all aspects of their performance, such as teaching attitude, rather than merely depend on their studentsâ€™ perform."
Mandarin,"0.o It has been two weeks since the last journal. During this time I started my first chargeable project, what's more, I got another big opportunity which was a very long project since 3rd in July. I think I'm really a lucky guy, cause I still received a email from DL GDC this morning, which offered me a chance to take part in a Dutch airport project, though I don't know whether they will be satisfied with my experience. And I still have another task, word of the day, which spend me about twenty minutes to paste the word sheets here and there in company. I did it not only for the utilization, but also for learning English and Japanese, and it's proved useful. In the last days, I watched the fifth season of LOST, which start to explain the puzzles in the past several seasons. The island is very very odd, the ones who came to the island can heal all kinds of sicks, memory loss, cancer and disability, even death. On the other hand, they lied, doubted, killed, destoried, and set off the nuclear bomb. But all of these are reasonable, I think. Maybe they were healing their souls, cause they showed their love to each other, and themselves. In the last episode of season five, the 'fake' John Locke had Ben kill Jacob in 1977, and Juilet set off the bomb thrity years later. Season six will show in 2010, I really wanna know how everything is going. Time shuttling is a interesting topic. There will be a Japanese test, so I need to take some time to prepare for that now. Byebye."

Mandarin,"The film of 2012 2012 is a disaster movie about global destruction in 2012, it tells when the end of the world comes, the protagonist and people across the world how to struggle for life. The protagoniset is a failure in the writer, he kown the information that the world is going to be destroyed by chance ,in order to save his family,he started a soul-stirring the adventure travel. Movie scene appeared that California sinking into the sea, Kennedy crashed into the White House, aircraft carriers, Yellowstone volcano eruption, awash and several other major Himalayan art scene, is indeed imagination and visual effects technology perfect union's classic lens. But what can move truly audience is the humanâ€™s tenacity. So many people say that China element become mainstream Hollywood commercials in recent years, and is the most performance of a positive in the film 2012. The ark is made in China, it shows that China is a big manufacturing factory. I donâ€™t know it were a good thing or a bad thing. In my opinion, it seem laugh at China anyway. When the protagonist family and his boss came to China just meet with Chinese air force. The sad thing is that soldiers let the rich man get on the plane who have the green card plane and unrelenting abandoned the man who isn't very wealthy . I think, in that danger time, if that is true Chinese, they will let all the people on the plane . This lens is damaged Chinese visualize more or less. In conclusion, 2012 is good movie that is worth to be watch. It gives people's revelation is to protect our earth, because the earth is our only home. That is everyone responsibility, also the obligation to protect the environment."
Mandarin,"The small things that make me happy I think sometimes small things can make me feel happy, but sometimes not.

Mandarin,"I need a very urgent help~ could you help me correct my very short essay? It means a lot to me~~~Please~~ It is difficult for governments in developing countries to decide which should promote first when confronting advanced skills & technologies and education. Personally, I fully sanction that governments in those developing countries should give priority to education. With incredible fast development of this world, there are extensive needs for highly skilled and trained people. We should clearly understand that the competitions for advanced technologies are, in face, competitions for outstanding professionals. Therefore, it would seem that education should be paid more attention, because it can foster many competent people thereby contributing to high speed development of societies. Believe it or not, there exists many evidences to prove that promoting education first is correct. Take Japan for instance, after warâ…¡, the economy of Japan was destroyed devastatingly. People were poor and depressed. Surprisingly, the government at that time, invested a majority of money in schooling, simply in order to promote the education. As a result, Japanese economy ranked top ten in only a decade. Interestingly, it was a very important shift for Japan impressing the world as a country with numerous high technologies. That is to say, improvements of industrial skills and modern technology are based on widespread education. Some people may worry that promotion of education cannot impose direct benefits on societies in comparison to improvement of techniques. In my opinion, it is true that impact on developments of societies are delicate in a very short time. However, when it comes to a long term, education is the most effective and efficient way for a countryâ€™s prosperity. To sum up, it would be a wise choice for a developing country to promote education first, because it can not merely offer a multitude of excellent professionals, but giving a rise to improvements of modern technology and industrial skills at the same time."

Mandarin,"Personal Statement Personal statement My name is Yangbin, a student from China, Dalian University of Foreign Languages, majoring in computer science (Japanese and English bilingual education). I would like to scale higher intellectual heights by taking advanced studies in your Master's program. Such studies will help me make great progress on knowledge of literature in my field. It was Grade Two of my High School when I first contacted with Internet technology, I was curious, and eager to discover how it all worked. As my understanding of computer technology accumulated, I was draw further and further into this amazing new world. Human beings had made tremendous progress, building new roads along the great highway of civilization. Wonders such as distance learning, virtual reality and robot on intelligence. So I made up my mind to choose computer science as my major. At the same time, I was also keen on learning foreign language , then I attended Dalian University of Foreign Languages. In my undergraduate studies, I benefited from the Software Academy of Dalian University of Foreign Languages that had given me a comprehensive exposure to the core areas of Computer Science and a strong conceptual understanding of that. In these three and half years of study, I had strived to maintain an approach of expending independent effort in all my endeavors. Learning independently and sharing my knowledge with others has been most worthwhile, when it came to comprehending a concept. At the same time, I also learnt Japanese which was my first foreign language, and got the certification of JEPT2. Over the past two years, I had developed an interest in the areas of Compiler Construction and Information Retrieval. The Compiler Construction lab sessions last semester required the design of a compiler for java programs that were restricted to loops, Switch case statements and simple input and output. The work involved in this, as well as the courses, Formal Systems and Automata and Compiler Construction had led me to appreciate the intricacies in this field. When I became a junior student, I attended the practical training courses offered by NIIT. During the course, I could use the C# and ASP. NET very well. However, for my MS degree, I remained open to other topics as well. Through the years I spent on learning IT, I found that it was an industry which could change the world, at the same time, make human life more colorful and convenient. So I decided to continue to pursue a master degree in IT field. When I was a high school student I first heard of your university and how it motivates bright young researchers to realize their ambitions. After a careful study of your university, I felt my study could be further developed in your university with advanced research facilities, first-class faculty, and excellent academic atmosphere. Convinced that my academic background had prepared me for becoming a suitable student at your university, I am also certain that with your guidance I will spare no effort to contribute to life science. In conclusion, I would like to add that the essence of university education lies in the synergetic relationship between the student and his department. I feel that graduate study at your university will be the most sensible extension of my academic pursuits and a major step towards my objectives. I would be grateful to you if I could grab this opportunity to pursue my graduate studies at your institution."

Well, so far I have never experienced something I believe was a big failure, but I do have something that I really donâ€™t satisfied with. It was when I first took over the minister of the propaganda department. And I was totally new to this position. I had no idea what to do and how to do it. You know as a minister, I not only took over all the jobs and also the contacts of the ex. Shortly after my succession, I got my first mission. Our team must designed a poster for a event to a deadline. I canâ€™t recall what it is about but I do remember the guy I came to for printing the poster. At first, I contacted him by phone, he said yes ok, you can just send me the file by e-mail, and I will give the poster some time, someplace. He sounded a little uncertain, but I chose to believe him. When the day he promised came, I didnâ€™t see my poster. So I called him again to check. He said sorry, it was almost done, give me more time. How stupid I am. I believed him AGAIN. And probably you see the next , I got fooled again. At last I had to tell my boss about it. Fortunately, the mission was not so important. I still had time to fix it. So I decided to meet this man in person, and got the poster done as soon as possible. This man is a person that takes credit as nothing, and my mistake is believing him. I donâ€™t understand how the ex-minister put up with him, but I never come to him for printing again. Here is what I learn from. (I find I canâ€™t describe what I learned. I want to express the meaning that you cannot fully believe some guy you donâ€™t know well, and always leave some space or some way to fix it. Can anybody say it in a good way?) Failures should be treated as obstacles to overcome not as a reminder to keep you feeling bad about yourself. I mean, it happens, if you were put down by failure doesnâ€™t mean you were a failure. You learned from your mistakes, but it was past history, today, you should focus on looking forward, not backward."

Mandarin,"Hiï¼Œeveryone,I need your help!!!(1) Introductions:The following composition was written by an English learner according to a topic,you can point out any mistakes if you wanted to. Any suggestions of corrections in relation to the topic will be accepted humbly by the author. (including task response,coherence and cohesion,lexical recources,grammatical range and accuracy) Topic:Foreign tourist abroad should be charged more than local people when visiting the local historical and cultural tourist attractions. To what extent do you agree or disagreeï¼Ÿ Never in human history have we witnessed such an overwhelming problem of whether it is reasonable to charge more for the foreigners than indigenous dwellers when visiting the historical sites. From my perspective, such behavior is by no means unjustified. It is acknowledged that the government, which aims at illuminating the culture, should give priority to local people, making them keep the history in mind. On such occasion, only through price mechanism can they ensure the superiority of local citizens when treating with domestic travelers and exotic visitors. Under that circumstance, the indigenous individuals may feel a sense of national pride, which enables them to work and study more diligent for the prosperity of their own countries. In addition, charging more for the people from other countries is not only able to boost the local economy but also providing an approach to relieve the financial burdens of the government, which is conducive to the development of society. Apart from this, if folks from any places were asked the same price, then, an upset sensation among indigenous people will emerge, losing cultural identity and social belonging. The opponents, however, argue that the culture relics belong to the human beings that each individual ought to be considered equally, claiming that this is especially true in terms of the preservation of culture heritage. What I need to emphasize is that they didnâ€™t take other decisive factors into account. Compared with domestic dwellers, foreigners are more likely to spoil the historical sites, illustrating the fact that the possibility to guarantee intact sites is small, detrimental to the places of interest. In a nutshell, I am convinced that asking for the higher price for the exotic travelers is not unwarranted. For the sake of making the general public have a pride sensation as well as booming the economy, it is advisable to do so."
Mandarin,"Dog I like dog very much. My family raised a little puppy When I was an elementary school student. It is femail. From now more than ten years lapsed. She once had taken sick so badly a few years ago. So sadly,we also thought she woudl be die soon. In hospital the doctor said let her relaxed to died. At that time mother decided to do it the next day. Consequently that morning I was so sorrowful and had no appetite. Afternoon when I come back she appeared on the home unexpectedly. Mother didn't took her to the hospital. She looked better more than before. The next few days it gradually recovered from its illness. Until now she is still living and I believe it was nothing less than a miracle. Maybe she will die after two or three years."

Mandarin,"A New Journey Here is a composition and I would appreciate it if anyone could help me correct it.(*^__^*) Itâ€™s a sunny day when I first came to the coastal city where I was to begin my college life. A thirteen-hour train journey had made me totally worn out, but I knew another new journey was waiting for me. After arriving at the campus, I followed the suggestion my families had given to meâ€”work hard and care about my own business. As a result, I looked a bit like a loner, doing all kinds of assignments at most of time, while chatting with roommates a little. Even so, they had been very friendly to me and never stood by when I was in trouble. Two months later we heard the news that a contest called One week of my dormitory was going to be held. It aimed at showing dormitory culture and required every group to present it to juries and audience on the day of contest. I was preparing for the mid-term exams then and had no interest in that contest. But the other three girls in our room were very excited at the news and began to discuss it eagerly. Finally they came up with a plan according to the contest rules, in which each of us should draw a picture and decorate our room with different styles. Since they all showed great enthusiasm, I thought Iâ€™d better not to disappoint them. So I spent half a day on designing and drawing my picture. Before going to bed, I put it up, thinking that I had finished my part in the group work. As with the others, they had also contributed a lot to the decoration. Besides, two of them made a movie about our daily life and the culture of our dormitory. When it came to the question who should present it, they considered me the best choice, for I had a proper voice for the presentation. I didnâ€™t want to waste more time on the useless thing, so I refused without more consideration. Apparently they were a little dissatisfied with me, but they didnâ€™t force me to accept their advice. Eventually another girl took my place on the day of contest. Although the presentation was not perfect, but due to our attractive decoration and impressive movie, we got the highest score and won the first prize. In the following awarding ceremony, everyone was very happy, including me. But in the thunderous applause of congratulations, my inner voice was extraordinary sharp. â€œYou are too cold and selfish to deserve it.â€ I suddenly realized I actually was. How could I do that? They regarded me as a friend while I took everything for granted. If it was me who did the presentation, maybe we have done it better. I felt ashamed when my roommates smile sincerely at me. I found that suggestion wasnâ€™t always right. I was not alone. In many cases, it was far from enough only to care about my own business. Especially in a group, corporation was necessary and everyone was supported to do his best. Since then, I have changed a lot. I began to try something I used to think useless and found my college life more enjoyable. In college, study is important, but not crucial. And it shouldnâ€™t occupy all of my time. There is a fact no one can deny that something else is much more valuable than study on this journey, such as friendship."

Only two colors filled our eyes, one sky blue and the other is tree green. But unfortunetly the ones Johan wanted weren't the same like the products there. I felt sorry for Johan, because I told him I could find a factory for him. We had dinner at the restaurant the same as yesterday. We talked much at the dinner table. Bobby found her glasses lost.. They just said goodbye to all of us and went back to Quanzhou directly. When I came back, I felt very tired.."

Mandarin,"Free Admission to museum Free Admission to museum Over the last few decades['dekeid], science and technology have pervaded every aspect of human life. Nowadays people are devoting themselves to learning for pursing [pÉ™:sing] a better life. Recently, more and more parks, zoos, and museums are being built; whatâ€™s more many museums are all free. A large number of people canâ€™t help wondering ['wÊŒndÉ™riÅ‹] if the museums are meaningful. In fact, as we are enjoying a better life, peopleâ€™s thought are changing. Food is not the only thing we longing for any more. Many people want to improve their spiritual standard ['stÃ¦ndÉ™d]. So, the museum is a good place for people to broaden their minds. If we can visit a museum for free, more and more people could have the chance to learn. Even though free admission to museum have a lot of benefits; however, there are still some problems. Some people are lacking of the sense of protection. As is known, the exhibits in museum are precious but fragile. The more people visit museum the easier the things can be broken. The management of the museum can be a very tough mission for those employees in museum. As the saying goes â€œevery coin has two sides â€. we canâ€™t easily say it is good or not for museum to open to public for free. But I think the knowledge in museum is invaluable. If we can achieve them in a free way that can be fabulous."
Mandarin,"A Restaurant I Like A Restaurant I Like The restaurant, happiness 131, is one of my favorite. I like it not only because of its food but also its name and the happiness it brought to me. The restaurant locates No. 131 Xinfu Rd. Xinfu in Chinese means happiness which make it selected as a scene for a famous idol drama which name is â€œCorner with Loveâ€. No wonder more and more people come to the restaurant. I remember it is the place in where I dated with my girl friend, who now is my wife, for the first time. Although it has been two years yet I can still remember the day clearly. The restaurant looks primitive but tidy. It is not conspicuous at the side of the road if there is not two big Chinese characters â€œå¹¸ç¦â€ on the top of the wall. In daytime, it is really peaceful. However, you can see many people are eating in full swing through the big window in its wall when you pass by it in the evening and there is always a long line outside during the evening. Going into the restaurant, on the right side, there is a wishing wall on where many boys and their girl friends write down their wishes in a paper and stick it. They believe their wishes made in this way will come true someday. And they are pretty useful for the restaurant in busy time; people do not feel boring while waiting for seats. On the left side and second floors, wooden tables with benches are placed orderly. Its dishes are pretty attractive. My wife and I always order three dishes which are grilled fish, grilled potato and pork ribs and cold noodles. Grilled fish is served in a metal dish, peppered with pimiento and Zanthoxylum bungeanums and with some burning charcoal under it, which make it a good choice in cold days. The cold noodles are so called â€œé»¯ç„¶é”€é­‚é¢â€ because you cannot help tearing while eating it, the secrecy is the mustard in them. Although the two dishes are really delicious, only grilled potato and pork ribs can make us full owning to its quantity. This is the restaurant that I think is worth having a try. However, you had better go either early or late to avoid busy time if you do not want to wait in line."

Mandarin,"People can solve important problems by themselves or with the help from their family members so there's no need for the government to help them. Some people may think without the governmentâ€™s support, they still can solve some important problems by themselves or their familiesâ€™ help. But I disagree. In my opinion, if we live without the help of the government, the life of us may be difficult and we may probably live in a chaotic society, just like that of primitive people. The first thing that the government helps us is about the social security. Without the governmentâ€™s help, no one can imagine how mass our world would be. There may be plenty robberies, murders and even wars would be there. So without the governmentâ€™s help, our world would be chaotic, how can a person solve important problems in that chaotic world? Second, the government keeps the safety of products and the price of some daily needs. They would send people to search for the unsafe products and tell the public as soon as they find it. Like the incident of plastic in Taiwan, China, if the government hadnâ€™t told the public about the hazardous plastics, more and more babies would be poisoned by that plastic milk bottle. And think of the Japan earthquake, the salt price increased a lot after the explosion of nuclear station. People waited in lines to buy salt everyday. Then the government came out to say that the salt was actually from inner part of the land not the sea, and they also say that no one can rise the price of salt except the government themselves. They save our own interests. Last, the government tries to build a convenient and good-qualified society for us all. They built new subway lines, rebuilt some roads and dangerous buildings. Without their effort, our life canâ€™t be so convenient as todayâ€™s. The government truly helps us solve plenty of important problems such as social security, the safety of products, the price of our daily needs and the transportation. Without the governmentâ€™s help, no one can solve these problems by themselves or the help of their family members."

In modern socity,peoples' lives conditiong getting more and more comfortable . Depending on their parents,many colleges hire house help in order to clear their dormitory. Different people hold differernt views on this thing. Some consider that it isn't bad for university students. Others disagree with it. Should colleges hire house help?Is it right or wrong for colleges hire house help? Many college students think that study are their first assignment. To start with,learning knowledge in the book is the most important thing in the campus. Moreover,They maintain that doing some house work is either wasting their time or hindering their study . For example,university student can use this time to learn more knowledge or rest. What's the most important,they believe the house help do better than theirseleves. Only cost little money,dorimtory will be clear and tidy immediately. Colleges required fresh environment to study so baning a house help is the best way to reach it. Not a few people argue that school should abandon colleages to ban a house help. Becuse house work as important as study. In the first place,It train us ablity and hardwork. In the second place,Hiring a house help instead of doing house work by theirselves will make me lazy in the furture. Last but not least,colleges don't spend any money . In my opinion,I oppose colleges hire a house help to clear their dormitory. If we can do,just do it. Do some house work are easy anf funny. It is essential to do some house work for college students. We can learn other different knowledege though doing house work."

On the way to the small traditional chinese medical clinic,I felt that every breath I took was full of moisture. In fact,it was almost like walking in a big wet sponge. There was already 7 patient waiting in the corridor when I stepped into the clinic. The elderly doctor spent half a hour with one patient,and her worktime ends at 11:30.

The biting wind hooted, threatening to tear her over-washed while well-shaped clothes up, and the lunch box in her hand. Smoothing the gray hair, she raied her eyes, tiptoed to look further, and the winkled face was more like the face of a small child, happy and innocent, longing for something more important than candies or toys.

One man got lost in the forest. He wanted to know the time but he didn't have a watch. Then he saw two girls playing in the forest. He came to them to ask for the time. One girl was fat and the other was skinny. The elder sister speaks the truth in the morning, and lies in the afternnon. The younger sister lies in the morning, and speaks the truth in the afternnoon.(Could I use this sentence to replace my last sentence? ""It's opposite to the younger sister."")

Russian,"PLEASE HELP TO CORRECT MISTAKES(((( People have different relationships with each other. In first all relationships built on trust. I think we should trust the people who are dear for us and we love. But if you want to have confidence between each other you should be honest. In my opinion it is one of the most important things between people. It is the key to all kinds' relationships. If you start to lie, it raises suspicious and mistrust. I think we should speak the truth even it is bitter. I consider that there is a not humane lie. Sooner or later, beyond all doubt, it will bring harm to anyone who believes in this delusion. On the one hand lied you can to hide the truth for a little time, but one the other hand if the truths come out? What you will do? By the way I think it will make your relationships worse or destroy them. As said Satin from the play By M. Gorkiy ""On the bottom"" -""Lie even salvation-it is the clearest manifestation of disrespect to the person. And I agree with him. Of course on the one hand keeping the honest and trusting relationships is hard work, but on the other hand it is the highest success of human relationships to which everyone should strive."

Russian,"....... I want to study several languages. It's very interesting to study a foreign language. When study it you learn culture another country. You must understand the structure of a language, you must understand haw think natives. Also very important to study new words, because even you have knowledge about structure, you can say nothing. I need a lot of practice foreign language and thereto I read English texts, study new words and write here."
Russian,"How to save time. Method of saving time (letâ€™s escape from perfectionism) Find a little time and think, why do you check yourself many times, pay too much time and attention to things which could be done in one minute? Put down on the paper what disturbs you to work without mistakes and failures? Usually there is only one reason â€“ dismay. It takes us into stress and disables to live normal life. (I am really in panic as I am afraid to make a mistake and always must check everything which has been already done. Sometimes I even do not remember if I have completed something or not. I am afraid and ashamed not to keep my promises despite a can not cope with this all!) Make an analysis, how real are your fear. Is not it, may be even partly, the result of your own fantasy? Think, are you responsible enough for your job? The answer is positive off course. Then why do you keep yourself so tensed? How fatal are mistakes you may probably make doing your work? It is unlikely that world will be turned upside-down if you mistook sending required paper to wrong folder. Most of mistakes are correctable with more or less time spending! Find the balance with yourself, learn to respect yourself and your work. Do not be hurry neither with pronouncements, nor with actions. The work which is done quietly and thoroughly will give you satisfaction and as a result â€“ self-reliance. Moreover, the quality of such work will me much better."
Russian,"Founders at Work I was reading Founders at Work for about two or three months. Got it on my Kindle and then on my iPad's Kindle App. Now I'm done and got a few words to say about the book. The author of Founders at Work, Jessica Livingstone, have done great deal of work. She interviewed 32 founders of famous startups and big companies. Steve Wozniak from Apple, Charles Geschke from Adobe, Craig Newmark (the guy founded Craigslist) and so on. It is a beautiful journalistic creation but there are pits on the road. All of them founders are geniuses. So you're reading their bios and get something while examining their thoughts but cannot repeat their success. In some cases it is great reading but on the other hand - dull list of somebody's success stories. My friends recommend me Rework written by guys from 37Signals but I'm not sure I want to read another startup success story turned to step by step manual. What books did you read recently? What kind of stories do you like? Write me a comment below."

Russian,"Something as intro. Well, it's pretty hard to start, but I'll try. I would be able to say that I'm 27 years old, like computers and internet, reading books in english and other ""blah-blah"" stuff like that. But, imho, it's not the kind of things that is really interesting for reading. Who cares, by the way? So... Six years ago I had meet with a girl on the site of blogs and (as I've thought) fallen in love. I droped my job, leave my family and friends, and moved in the city there my intended wife lived. After six years of cohabitation, we broke off our relations, and I've come back in my city. When I rode to home (it was approximately 1,5k km) in a truck of my family's friend, I have a plenty time to think about what I learned and done in this years, and was it a waste of time or not. Now, I suppose that the time was not useless. I got some live experience, and I use to think, that all experience is usefull, not matter good it or bad. And today I have no sorry about my ""Epic of Omsk"", as I'm describing the years. It's my life, and nobody can live it instead of me. P. S. I pretty good read in English, but writing at first time of my life. I'll be very pleased if you correct me, my dear readers."

My specialty - teacher of Russian language and literature. So I can teach, yes :D But I want to know English well. The hardest thing for me are the articles, prepositions, and tenses. There are so many tenses in English : )In Russian there are only three tenses. And in Japanese - only two =) That is why I love the Japanese :D"
Russian,"Tarkovsky Iâ€™m reading Andrei Tarkovskyâ€™s diaries. I usually donâ€™t like to read something personal about famous people, because it often disturbs to interpret their art, but I made a little exception:) I know that Andrei is very famous all over the world. Here in Belarus very many people love his movies, too. I like his films very much, especially â€œSoliarisâ€ and â€œThe Mirrorâ€. When he was alive he was considered as a real legend. However, his fate wasnâ€™t kind. In the USSR he was half-forbidden. They let him make movies and even show them in movie theatres, but they were always putting incredible obstacles in his way. Iâ€™m sure that if Andrei had lived abroad, he would have made 40 or so movies. It was even funny when everybody in Europe knew Tarkovsky as the best Soviet filmmaker, and in the USSR they said him: â€œAndrei, your film is bad and obscure. You should do it over. Until that itâ€™s not going to be shownâ€. Actually, Iâ€™m sure that in contemporary Belarus he wouldnâ€™t make one single film, because they would say the same thing and he couldnâ€™t resist that! Itâ€™s hard to read his diaries because he was quite a difficult person. He was angry and even inclined to misanthropy. He often criticized severely and even abused those who were by him and otherâ€™s creative works. He was cold. You can often read something like: â€œHe died this morning. I should buy fruits todayâ€. You would never think that he was like that judging by his humanistic films, but he really was. By the way, itâ€™s strange why some genius works of art become famous and others donâ€™t. For example, such Soviet filmmakers as Sokurov and Muratova arenâ€™t worse than Tarkovsky, but very few people know about Sokurov and almost nobody knows about Muratova. Iâ€™m pretty sure that 99% of genius poetry and prose collect dust in bureaus."
Russian,"First entry Ah, that thingie just reminded me that I should write an entry. No idea what to write about, let's just see if I'm able to produce consistent English, at least on paper (on monitor, you'd rather say :) ). Although I don't like these commercialized sites that offer everything in the form of several easy steps, I have to admit that the vast and helpful community easily overcompensates it :) As I noticed people like to break things into paragraphs here, sometimes having a dedicated one for each sentence. Just like the one above. And forgive me for having such a silly entry title. I really couln't come up with anything better. In case you have nothing to correct (I am too optimistic today) leave a note so I know it doesn't get ignored."
Russian,"Caesar One of the most famous people in the history was Caesar. He lived in Ancient Rome. And he believed that his ancestor was Venus. It was a time when the republic suffered from constant crisis and some people tried to capture the throne. He went step by step to his goal. And in year 58 b. c. he gets to the top of roman army in Gallia (modern France). He was a good warrior and politic. Soon Gallia became a roman province. Caesar became a very rich and he had a great and experienced army. He said why not? And one crossed Rubicon. It was a beginning of the civil war. It continued four years. Many times he was winner, but some times he could die. The Caesar army battled in Spain, France, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Egypt and Algeria. It was a world war of that time. After that he became an imperator and actually a king. He was famous like a very clement man. It was unusual in that time. But those people who were saved him during war killed him when he was alone and without arm. It was a very tragic lesson for next generations of lords."

Russian,"Abaut children in Japan (my english exersise) Es known, in Japan children are thought a precious presents from God. Itâ€™s rarely to see in Japan a child who is crying. Nothing is forbidden for the Japanese child â€“ he here only the werning: â€œit is dangerousâ€, â€œit is dirtyâ€, â€œit is badâ€. But if is still hurt or burn himself, mother thinks that itâ€™s her fault and apologize to him. Until five years the Japanese treat with a child like with a king, since 5 until 15 â€“ like with a slave, after 15 â€“ like with an equal. There is a method to bring up which is called â€œthe lost childâ€ or â€œmaigoâ€. When a child is bored to be always attached to his mother, he started to appear an independence and a curiosity. He is given the possibility to be lusted. All of the people around know this trick very well and find a maigo without any problems and make it clear: how bad to be maigo and how good to find mother again."

Firstly a would like to install a programm to write japaneese on my computer, do you know where can i find it? Travelling around the Japan was amazing. I don't really believe we were in this far off country. The nature of Japan absorbs your attention and you are standing on the road in Tokio, open-mouthed, wondering with a speed of life. Everything we saw was done with a love and exactitude. The food is fantastic. But somewhy I thought that most of japaneese people don't like foreigners. They wewe friendly, but their smile was artificial. That is very sad. In a bookshop near of our hotel I bought a book ã¨ãªã‚Šã®ãƒˆãƒˆãƒ­ - I love it so much.

Russian,"Essay Hello i learn to write an essay but it is very difficult can you help me and correct mistakes?? Thank you The issue of education is always discussed in society. On the one hand all students must have equal opportunities and rights, but on the other hand free education creates high costs for taxi payers and government. It is therefore necessary to consider whether university education should not be free. Not everyone should pay all fees. Students from low-social background can have a lot of problem if they have to bear the high costs. They need a job to finance their university education, when their families can not help them financially. University education of these students suffers of the necessity to have a job. The supporters of free education demand that government take on the costs. University education gives benefits to the rest of society. The opponents mean that these costs are too high for government and taxi payers. If university education were being free some students could miss the lessons, while they paid for nothing and university education could be prolonged instead of five years to seven or more years. If students pay for education they are more motivated and try to give their best. The government can help students who can not pay for university education and give them a loan. Free education is not good for the country and government. For example, foreign students study at a university and return from abroad to home. Government invested in education, but government did not make profit from that. University education should not be free because it is not profitable for the country and government. Good university education is expansive, but educated people have better prospects to find a good job."

His name is Yaroslav, just like his grandfather's. But I have lots of other names for him. He was born exactly three years after my marriage. So, we have three reasons to celebrate that day: I met my husband, married him and gave birth to our son on the same day! Yarik can stand on his feet and even walk with my assistance. He has six teeth and one more is coming. He is his father's copy and he's the cutest boy I've ever seen. He smiles a lot, dogs make him laugh. He likes tomatoes. No, he adores tomatoes! He could sell his soul for just one little bite of tomato! =)) He's a very busy child, you can never see him sitting idly, he's always crawling somewhere - there's so much to see, to do and to learn! I had to give up origami, because he shows too much interest in small pieces of paper. I took up knitting instead. Yarik likes balls of yarn as much as pieces of paper, but at least he can't eat them. =)) Life has changed dramatically after his birth. The most difficult thing was to put up with the fact, that I no longer belong to myself. My son owns me ""completely and entirely"". He doesn't care if I'm tired, hungry or sick. He wants me no matter what. As soon as I accepted this fact, everything got much easier. So now I simply enjoy the time I spend with him, because in a couple of years he will become more independent and won't need me that much."
Russian,"environmental protection: problems and tasks Environmental protection is the main problem that mankind faces nowadays. One of the most serious problems is pollution of land (soil pollution), water and air with different wastes. The reason is that the society produces too much package, litter and garbage that is dumped in the streets or accumulated on either litter tips or landfill sites. As a result streets are being made dirty and diseases are spreading quicker. People should use dustbins and dispose litter in designated areas. Besides, we have to recycle refuse such as scrappaper, bottles, clothes etc. dumped chemicals can lead to lung diseases and even a threat of skin cancer. Yet another problem is deforestation. As a result of it the amount of oxygen reduces. Scientists are worried about changes of weather. Climate is changing very quickly due to global warming. The growing number of automobiles produce car exhaust fumes that also assist the greenhouse effect. Environmental deterioration takes badly its toll on people's and animals' health. If we don't stop abusing nature, it can end up in a complete depletion of natural recources and a disaster for humanity."

Russian,"abstracts 1)The article analyzes the operations of temporary work agencies dealing with the provision of workforce as well as the normative enactments applicable to such labour relations and requirements stipulated in the European Union law. The aim of the article is to analyze the working principles and legal regulations (incl. enhancement of contractual relations) at the temporary work agencies as well as to investigate the issues analyzed in the directive. Although Directive 2008/104/EK â€œon temporary agency workâ€ entered into force since November 19th , 2008, Latvia still does not have a clearly defined status of a temporary worker or the type of work dealing with provision of such labour force and such relations are regulated by the general provisions of the Labour law that unfortunately do not provide for the requirements laid out in the European Union law. The employment and contractual obligations are unclear and legislators urgently have to amend the legal provisions in order to ensure equal treatment, labour protection and qualitative work for temporary agency workers. 2) The article is devoted to detention in the criminal trial of the Republic of Latvia. Detention takes the leading place in the system of measures of judicial compulsion, which has been depicted in the article. Meanwhile, having common features with the measures of judicial compulsion, detention is exclusive. The author of the article has made an attempt to examine the reason, conditions and grounds of detention of suspect in crime commitment according to the ways of detention provided by Criminal Procedure Law. 3) Border checks on the land external border of the Republic of Latvia are performed in accordance with the Schengen Convention, Schengen Borders Code, Visa Code, Border Guard Law, State Border Law of the Republic of Latvia, Immigration Law, and other laws and regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers, which were issued in accordance with the above mentioned laws. The present article covers some contradictions and drawbacks of the legal regulation concerned the terminology in use and correspondence of the national legal regulations to the international obligations. There are fifteen border crossing points with the extremely high intensity of people and cargo flow on the external land borders of Latvia. This fact determines the necessity to harmonise the legal regulation, and the aim of the author is to describe the legal requirements related to the crossing of the external borders."
Russian,"Educational system in Kazakhstan Educational system in Kazakhstan differs from American or Britain. At the age of two or tree children can go to a kinder-garden but it is not necessarily. The children stay in the kinder-garden the whole day. They eat, sleep and learn there. They learn different things about surrounding world, numbers and letters. At the age of five they start writing. But they write only simple elements, like circles and lines. Not all children can go to the kinder-garden. It is difficult to get place there. Parents often queue when the child is not even born! And it is expensive. So, many children stay at home until they are six. From six years they have to go to school. Children who visited a kinder-garden go strait to the first form, but those who didn't must go th the preparatory classes first. There they study everything children study in a kinder-garden and it is free. At the elementary school children study with one teacher from the first up to the fourth forms. They study mathematics, Russian (as a native language in Russian schools and Kazakh as a native language in Kazakh schools), â€œcognition of surrounding worldâ€ (I don't know how to translate it correctly. It is a subject, combining biology, geography, social science and history, the simplest and fundamental topics from all this subjects), art, music, and self â€“ actualization. It is a new subject. It is studied in all forms at school and is something like physiology, but it is not a psychology in the ordinary sense of the word. Children learn here how to communicate with others, how to be good and kind, how to see beauty and help others to see it too. From the fifth form children go the a grammar school. They study there five years and it is often placed in the same building with elementary school. They study mathematics, native language, foreign language (mostly English but there are a few schools where children study German and French), physics, biology, geography, history of Kazakhstan and the world's history, religions (here they learn about different religions existing in the world from the secular point of view). Every subject they have once or twice a week, so they can have six or sometimes seven different subjects a day. In all forms children study Kazakh language in Russian schools and Russian language in Kazakh. After the ninth form children can leave school for a college or they can go to the high school and study there for two years more. If they go to a college, they study all the high-school program during the first year there and only from the second year they study special subjects. After the eleventh form children pass a big exam, a test, which takes place in a one day in the whole country. Whith the results of this test children can go to a university or a college. If they go to a college after the 11th form they study one year less."

I came to her and told about my situation. I do not have a job, and it is hard to find something good in our small town. She said that she knew a man who is a big businessman. And she was going to speak about me, she tried that he gave me a job. I talked 2 times to him and, in my opinion, he did not want to take me. However, I suppose he could not refuse her request. He owns hardware stores network. These stores are situated in many cities in Kazakhstan and abroad. The one position he was ready to offer was a seller. I had no choice. As more that year I have not worked. Moreover, the financial situation is worsening. Father is jobless. I also have not been earning for a long time. As a consequence, only my mother gets money and pays all expenditures. So, I had to accept his offer. Besides, I have something to share. But unfortunately, I am so tired now and ging to sleep."
Russian,"Philosophy Existentialism - scope of philosophy recognizing the true reality of being a single human personality. It has taken shape under the influense of social cataclysms of the 20th century. A man tends to his individual aims, creates himself, chooses methods and forms of their life. But in everyday life people can misunderstanding himself, they try to be like everyone else avoiding responsibility and freedom. The modern existentialism experienced the impact of phenomenology and found many threads related to the philosophy of life. The most prominent representatives of existentialism, where the founders was the Russian philosophers Berdyaev and Shestov, were the German thinker - Martin Heidegger and Karl Jaspers, the French ones - Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, Spanish - Juan Ortega y Gasset."

Russian,"Some statistics I couldn't think of a topic to write about today, but when I looked at the list of ""Entries awaiting your corrections"" (for me it was a list of entries written in Russian), I had an idea to compare it with other lists. All the entries have a lot of views, the average number of views for an entry is about 50, and for some entries it exceeds 100! But there are only 22 pages in this list, that's a pity. Please write more entries in Russian, everyone! ))) Then I looked at the lists of entries written in English and Japanese. The Japanese list has about 1000 pages, and all the entries have a lot of views, the average number is about 20. The good thing is that all the entries usually have not only corrections, but commets too. But the most impressive is the English list, of course. It has approximately 2000 pages. But there are some entries that weren't read even once. Well, this isn't strange at all, since there are probably just too many entries written in English. And now I'm going to add another one to the list ))"

Russian,"Only mountains can be better than mountains! One of my favorite hobbies is skiing. Unfortunately my city is settled in a hilly place so there aren't good mountains for skiing. Actually, there generally aren't mountains at all )). But in the suburbs we have several places which would be good for teaching skiing- Not tall, steep, slick slopes. But you should totally forget about freeriding. Of course there are even signboards like ""Wild slope""... but... you know... it's ridiculous))). On weekends in May I went out of the polar circle to the mountains called Hibiny. Oh, there really are a lot of wild slopes with the threat of avalanches there! Magnificent fresh snow, the sun was shining... uninhabited... What else do you need for great skiing? So I had really unforgettable weekends. This year I'm going to go skiing in the Alps or maybe I'll stay in Russia and go skiing in Elbrus - these are two fundamentally different types of skiing! In Europe, of course, you'll have good and expensive service and tall, slick slopes, and in Elbrus or in Cheget there aren't any services and you can have a great freeride there (on slopes which don't know what ""snowcat"" means))). It just depends on my friends. But my greatest dream will always be wild Alaska. I know, skiing there is almost impossible for me, but ski movies about it are really impressive!"

Russian,"How I chose boots for Sasha and didnâ€™t choose anything The problem of choice is facing us every day. We choose our profession, the style of life, friends and such usual things like food or clothes. Perhaps the most long-term and silly choice is a choice of clothes. Because we waste long time for find that we want. As for me I like shopping, I like to help to my friends to do the shopping but I find that It is an impermissible luxury to waste much money and time for this process. But like almost every girl I do shopping regularly. So I want to describe you my last shopping day. It was yesterday. I went with my new friend Sasha to choose boots for him. I had never helped anybody to buy menâ€™s boots. It was my first experience. In the beginning of this story I want to tell the truth that of course we didnâ€™t find anything. Sasha and I had a special taste and to be honest I wasnâ€™t a good adviser. May be I felt shy, may be, there were no good boots in the shop that looked like market, may it wasnâ€™t our day) But I get pleasure from this shopping day. We went to the new shopping center named Europe and looked different video installations. I liked the last one and the video about the destiny of Islamic women. After we eat bread and talk and Sasha was in old boots) It is to be regretted that sometimes Itâ€™s difficult to make a choice of such usual things like boots. And we should waste our time to find â€œour oneâ€. But even boots are important details of us. And itâ€™s good that we can combine business with pleasure: to do shopping and to have time with friends"

Russian,"My psychology progect As I know that a good beginning is half the battle, I started from the bag. I tried to make it pretty and cute, but without too much glitter. I want to make an impression that I am kind, helpful and optimistic, thatâ€™s why I chose flowers and butterflies to add on my bag. Something of interest to me I am really proud of my native country, city, parents and friends. I add flag, as a symbol of Russia, church as a symbol of my native city- it is the most famous place in Yaroslavl. Also, I add the photo of my Mom, because she is the main part of my family. On the background of this photo there is the best and the most famous university in Russia. On that day I came there to write a contest, because my composition was chosen as one of the best in our country, this is one more thing, I am proud of . And the last photo-my friends and me. These people are very important for me, because with them every day brings something new and positive. With a support I can do almost everything, I think, and my friends give it to me to the full, when I need it. Sometimes I certainly miss these places and people, thatâ€™s why these photos are in this section. Something important to me I tell you my story. In the childhood I was really my fatherâ€™s daughter. I could listen to his stories eternally and his opinion was the most important in the world. One day he presented me a yellow bookmark with a picture of a cat on it. That simple gift was so unexpected and cute, that I was very happy. I keep that bookmark for 10 years already. And also, since that day, cats are my favorite animals. A small thing of great importance. Music that I like and that represents me  I can play the guitar. You know, music for me it is something indescribable, a mystery. Dad played the guitar and sang songs to me. We had our special song, which we composed together. When the guitar appeared in his arms, everything lost any sense. And that charm of music was the main reason why I began to attend my guitar class. After my guitar teacher found out that I can sing well and since then I fell in love with not easy, but so beautiful jazz music. I always sing: when I washing the dishes, when I taking a shower, when I doing my homework etc. Something that I think represents psychology Psychology for me-science, which helps people to understand themselves, to foresee dangerous places of life. Also, I think we need to study psychology to found out deep motivations and develop knowledge that we will use in the future career and family life. This picture represents processes in our mind. And it is the most interesting part of psychology, I think- to understand how everything works."
Russian,"What I have enjoyed in Malta What I have enjoyed in Malta is Mdina. It's an ancient city of Malta which is located at the top of the hill,on the island's highest point. Mdina is called ""The Silent City"" because only a limited number of inhabitans'cars,emergency and wedding cars are allowed in Mdina. It's great!!!! It is considered that apostle Paul,the founder of the Christianity,landed here after the ship-wreck. Sightseeings: the Main Gateway of Mdina, the Greek Gates, St. Paul's Cathedral, Carmelite Church, the Mdina's Dungeon. The first thing which we saw when we left the bus have arrived in Mdina was the statue of a loving couple,illuminated against the night sky. It was very romantic! then we saw the fantastic garden consisted from intricate trees through we could see the majestic main gateway of Mdina. It impressed me a lot! within two hours we were enjoying the narrow streets of the silent city astinishing the original Mdina's arhitecture. Suddendly I saw the open door in one of the Pallazzo and when i saw the ancient furniture with fretwork I decided that it was a museum. I asked a man who was inside if we could come in and have a look.

Just imagine: no public transport , more sleep , no rushing off to work , no tiresome coworkers to be friendly when you're having a bad mood, but as everything it has drawbacks. On the one hand working from home seems ideal. No one else dictates the work shedule . You can be the master of your situation. And of course there are no travel costs to and from work. It's appreciable saving of money . In addition to , a home working personliterally goes to work in their PJ's. Working at home doesn's work for everyone. When you work from home you don't have collegues or coworkers to share professional ideas. There's nobody to help you in solving professional problems. Besides, it may be difficult to separate personal responsibilities from professional responsibilities as a home worker. All in all working from home is the special way of provision of employment.

Application of modeling and forecasting capabilities in analytical tools of the risk management system in the Federal Customs Service In present-day conditions risk management in the Federal Customs Service of the RF is connected with handling and analyzing a large amount of different information on retrospective, real and predictable state of key indicators in foreign trade and activity of customs authorities. To effectively support making decisions in the risk management field, software tools of analysis, modeling and forecasting can be used. In whole, the application field of such tools can be different depending on problems to solve - from local tools for producing short-term forecasts with several key indicators to complex full-featured systems of modeling and forecasting covering hundreds of interrelated indicators (including key ones) with different activities. Such systems are used in a number of companies, financial institutions and public authorities. Nowadays one of the important goals in the Federal Customs Service of Russia is management of violation risk of the customs legislation. The problems of risk management system improvement in the Federal Customs Service of Russia take the centre stage. That becomes particularly important in current economic condition when goods turnover and receipt of money from customs payments in the federal budget are decreasing. In addition, some people, who transfer goods, tend to â€œoptimizeâ€ their expenses in customs registration of goods. Analytical tools of the risk management system are in the high light as just well-organized thorough analysis and modeling all information at hand on goods, transport means, documents and persons allow making efficient decisions and holding successful activities for customs surveillance. Efficient application of modeling and forecasting tools in the process of analysis and risk management is one of the components of successful work for abatement of damage from violation customs legislation. To solve such problems an automated system which supports decisions making in the field of analysis and risk management, is created and implemented in the Federal Customs Service of Russia. This system ensures modeling and forecasting the degree of divergence in statistics indicators of foreign trade which in turn can be potentially connected with an unreliable goods declaring. Technological subsystems of the developed program feature include the above-mentioned data storage as well as an administration and audit subsystem, a data upload subsystem and a reference data running. Functional block of data analysis and models plot area management allows experts analyzing indicators connected with risks presented in different profiles (goods, countries, customs authorities and others) and generated with data from different sources. Examples of analyzed indicators are volume of foreign trade in monetary and weight terms, amount of customs payments, volume of goods production and consumption in Russia, significance of differences in statistics data. The hallmark of this analysis is that by their results a localized list of goods and countries that will be used in modeling and forecasting is formed. For analysis the capabilities of multidimensional Express-Analysis (OLAP), specific report forms which ensure data visualization in charts and business graphics (including electronic maps of areas)."

Russian,"Learning Grammar Doesn't Help Me to Speak With English-Speaâ€‹king People. Due to the growing cultural exchange and internationaâ€‹l communicatioâ€‹n during the last century, learning foreign languages has become one of the most essential demands of our society, and can be compared with overall computer study. Being so widely spread throughout the world, language learning reveals lots of problems as people with different cultural background and unequal personal abilities expose themselves to foreign languages, bearing in mind various purposes and reasons: from elementary speaking skills for travelling abroad to academic writing, business language and learning just for fun included. Such diverse aims of language study required a great deal of assorted teaching techniques which were actually tried on during 1950s-80s. At that time grammar seemed to be the only obstacle in teaching speaking. Indeed, after having spent boring labourious years on grammar drills most of the students failed to produce even a comparativelâ€‹y short fluent utterance. It became evident that drilling separate grammar issues did not contribute much to intonation, rhythm and pronunciatioâ€‹n which may alter the connotation of the word or phrase. Learning grammar rules somehow prevented from using â€œfunctional languageâ€ which should be practised in guided speaking activities and â€˜real-lifeâ€™ situations. So, grammar was vigorously rejected; first â€“ by native language teachers, then â€“ from foreign language classes as well. New communicativâ€‹e approach, offering grammar skills through reading/speaâ€‹king activities, proved its attraction to students as they got highly motivated and started speaking as if by magic. Proclaiming grammar a useful tool, the teachers applied numerous activities to link phrasal verbs, prepositionsâ€‹, idioms and collocationsâ€‹ with images, emotions or situations in minds of their students. Acquiring fluent speaking in target language became the feature of this method. Later with much discontent researchers noted a correlation between the decline in teaching traditional grammar and a decline in test scores and poor writing skills, as naturally it is easier to speak language then to write. Favouring creative skills rather than productive led to inaccuracy in speech, both spoken and written. Another complicationâ€‹ in language teaching is caused by simplifying tendency via the Internet. Offering billions of free language learning resources, the Internet lacks in focusing on proper language â€“ since people manage to understand each other they pay no attention to grammar accuracy or enriching vocabulary. In many ways, the debate pros and cons traditional teaching approach has created a negative view of grammar. That is a pity. The best reasons for teaching grammar are positive. It seems logical that grammar should be taught together with speaking/lisâ€‹tening. At lower stages learning grammar creates a sense of successful studying, which is very important for further motivation. Investigatinâ€‹g grammar rules, describing forms and functions introduce students into communicativâ€‹e speaking from the very beginning, when they are not trained enough to discuss other topics. It is well known that traditional grammar teaching creates better and more accurate writers, whereas writing is considered to be one of main steps in mastering speaking. So, one may say, that now we are facing a â€˜back to basicsâ€™ alarm. The truth is in the middle, as usual."

Russian,"What Siberian Cities look like? Like almost all inhabitants of my hometown, Barnaul, I was pretty sure that I lived in a small town. It had a population of 650 000. When my English improved so I could communicate with people from other countries, my international friends didn't understand why I considered the Barnaul city a small town. The reason was that near Barnaul, there was a Novosibirsk city with a population of over 1 million. To the West, there was another city -- Omsk with a population of over 1 million. To the East, there was Krasnoyarsk city, that has a population of about 1 million. Indeed, Barnaul was like a suburban village compared to other Siberian cities. To my surprise, in Europe and North America the scale of what is a large city and what is not, differs much from mine. Now I realize that Barnaul, though not being the largest city in Siberia, is quite a big industrial center with well-developed infrastructure. Wooden houses are not common for Siberian cities. Normally, private houses are built from bricks, we call them cottages. Often, cottage communities are separated from the rest of the city and located in the suburban areas. The vast majority in Siberia lives in condos (like these ones in the pictures). During 1960th, the Soviet government deployed a country-wide construction program that had to solve the shortage for residential real estate in cities. Since then typical, rather ugly condos raised all across country. Siberia was not an exception. According to the Soviet government, it was a temporary solution, but, like Russians used to say, there's nothing more permanent than temporary solutions. These condos still serve to people, and more new condos were built during last 20 years. During the World War II, many industrial enterprises and factories were evacuated from the European part of Russia to Siberia by the rail way. While Western Russia were at high risk of being occupied, Siberia seemed a pretty safe place. Most factories in Barnaul and Novosibirsk are ones of those that were moved there during the WWII.

Russian,"Where People Not Bent The areas of permafrost are zones where the temperature inside the ground is less than 0Â°C for 2000-3000 years. The ground water is in state of ice to the depth of 1000 miters. During the summer, only surface of the ground ice melts, and this is a course of moving the ground. It is a big problem for engineers who construct in these areas. On the picture, there is a part of narrow-gauge railway near Norilsk, Siberia."

Russian,"Summer Jule-August 2011 This summer I spent one month being intern, and now I'm doing nothing for two weeks, even though I really need to study hard. My attempts to study with friends were trampled by our lazyness and inability to properly make study sessions. Whatever. Right now I'm listening to audio for learning grammar and will try to study by book I have, but unknown kanji are making me cry with frustration. I hope this will cease to happen too often when I receive my electronic dictionary. If there were people like the ones in higher year in my group, I would totally team up with them and make my way through levels. But alas, they are studing abroad for a year. Nevermind. I will do it nevertheless."
Russian,"English books. I bought a new book in English yesterday because I've read all the books I have at home. The problem is that there is not a very good choice in shops. Managers pick and order the most popular ones. Like Harry Potter or Daniella Steel or Candace Bushnell. That makes a choice very poor so hard. It's easier to find some really interesting book in the Internet and much more cheaper, but it is not comfortable to read electronic books. Internet shops gives more opportunities but all the books I really want cost very expensive, nevetheless sometimes I can find something not crazy expensive and interesting there and buy books this way."

Russian,"Article about the new calendar in 2010 I recently completed the calendar grid in the vector for 2010 in English and I want to publish it at my blog for free download, but I am afraid that there may be errors in the text. So please help me with English. Now I work a lot, but I still decided to provide free time to draw a few vector calendar grids to help fellow designers and everyone, who fact does know that these templates are always needed, but do not want to do it yourself and most the main thing - if you no time to draw up a new grid. In general, I prepared everything, download it and enjoy them all year. Variants of the grids is not so much, but it's the basis on which to create yourself calendars, saving you precious time. So, what we have in the archive? Three variants of the calendar grid in vector formats AI, PDF and 2 variants of pocket calendars. Most importantly - the fonts in the files stored in the form of text, not in the curves! That is, you will have the opportunity to change the font to any other, according to your's idea. Here I used common fonts Arial and Tahoma, the default on each computer. The colors in CMYK. I think you will like and save a lot of time. I'll be happy to thanks, the comments and will be very good, if you put in your blog or website backlinks to this article, thus more people learn about calendars and simplify their work. Another important detail - that are added to a few hand-drawn by the recent patterns of Russian khokhloma painting. Maybe, someone besides that calendars of Russian khokhloma painting seem interesting or just necessary, and here all the quality and free. This is I called ""Russian Season"". And comment it, if you liked!"

Russian,"Some depressing thoughts about language learning :) Sometimes I think that I'll never be able to use the language I'm studying properly. Even if I learn lots of words and grammar rules (I don't like learning grammar, by the way. I think it's a very unnatural way to learn a language), even so, I'll never be able to use the right ones in the right situations. This is really depressing. Especially Japanese. In English, I can at least express my thoughts, one way or the other, but I've come to believe that speaking in Japanese, even on simple everyday topics, isn't a skill, but an art. T_T I usually try to read books, or magazines, or Internet pages written in the language I'm studying, that's how I've practiced my English up until now. But with Japanese, reading is almost the most complex thing! Oh, what am I going to do... What a depressing entry I've just wrote. ))"

Russian,"New Year Holiday In Russia New Year is one of the most important holidays in Russia. I bet, every family in Russia stays awaken at least until 1 am at night from December 31st to January 1st , watching TV, eating delicious things and drinking champagne (or/and something else, but champagne is a must). *New Year vs Christmas* The Soviet Union was officially an atheistic country, where religious holidays were prohibited. In many families the tradition of celebrating Christmas was lost after the Revolution of 1917. However, the need for bright, magical winter holiday remained, and soon Christmas has replaced by New Year. Most Christmas attributes were adopted by the New Year holiday, like a decorated coniferous tree, gifts, heavy dinner, lights, garlands and firecrackers. Until now New Year is more popular and widely celebrated than Christmas in Russia. *New Year Tree* Families with kids normally decorate a New Year tree. Artificial trees are still not so popular in Russia (well, at least, in Siberia) because, first, many fir farms in Russia plant trees specially for the New Year, and second, artificial trees has no smell. The smell of fir for me is a symbol of the holiday since my early childhood, and without this magical smell the New Year is sort of defective. The most popular tree trimming decorations are baubles of various colors, tinsels, electric light garlands and a star on the top. When I was a kid, little toy bears, birds, glass icicles and snow-men toys were also widely used, but during last ten years, I can not find such toys in supermarkets and stores. May be, this is because Russian industry stopped producing native glass New Year toys, and most toys are imported ones. By the way, we do not use ribbons in Russia for decoration. Many cities and towns manage to decorate an open-air New Year Tree. In places like Siberia, where winters are cold enough, the entire snow towns rise at the main squares with the New Year tree in the center. Places that are not so lucky, put large inflatable dolls of Ded Moroz, Snegurochka and snowmen (see picture). *New Year Characters* The central character of the New Year holiday is Ded Moroz (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ded_Moroz). His name could be literally translated as Grandfather Frost. He plays a role similar to that of Santa, i. e. bring presents to children, but he does it in person, during the new year parties for kids that are organized in every day-cares and schools. However, these presents (mostly sweets) are not so important. A child finds his or her main present laying under the New Year tree early in the morning in January 1st. Ded Moroz wears a heel-long fur coat, a semi-round fur hat. Unlike Santa Claus, he walks with a long magical staff, does not say ""Ho, ho, ho,"" and drives troika. or just walks. Snegurochka (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snegurochka) or 'Snow Maiden,' is a granddaughter of Ded Moroz. She is kind and beautiful, with long blond hairs. Often the New Year fairy-tales and shows have a plot developed around the same situation: naive Snegurochka has got into troubles and a protagonist rescue her with the help of spectators. *The Dinner* There are no traditional New Year dishes in modern Russia, however, since the Soviet time, the Russian salad is somewhat mandatory (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_salad). In Russia and CIS it is called Olivier by Lucien Olivie, a chef who invented the recipe of a salad, however, the modern Olivier has nothing in common with the dish that was so popular in Moscow of 1860s. Butterbrots with caviar, salmon fish, sausages are very common, I believe, for all Russia's provinces. The main dish can be fried chicken (the whole chicken or parts), pork, beef â€“ actually, everything. In the Soviet Unions the smell of tangerines was one if the New Year's attributes. The reason is that there were standard New Year gifts for kids that included chocolate (natural dark chocolate only, no substitutes), candies, one big apple and tangerines or/and orange. Those gifts smelled like heaven and the dominant note was, of course, a tangerine. As I said above, champagne is a special New Year beverage. It doesn't mean that this is the only popular alcohol for the New Year party. Actually, people drink everything during the party, but right in the midnight, families and friends gather around the table, stand up and clink glasses with champagne wishing each other healthy, happy and prosperous new year. Happy New Year!"

Russian,Is it bad or good? Now I want to tell you a story. I think itâ€™s not a story itâ€™s a parable. It happened many-many years ago. One man lived in the small mountain village with his son. He was very proud having a beautiful white horse. The one unhappy day came and this horse went to the mountains and was be lost. All neighbors were so sorry about this loss. They said that itâ€™d been very bad accident. But our man was a kind of wise man who was not quick to conclusion. He answered for them: â€œ I donâ€™t know thatâ€™s bad or goodâ€. And he didnâ€™t look worry. After time his horse came back to home and then it was known that she was pregnant. Then our man had two horses. All his neighbors though that it was happy case. But he didnâ€™t it now again. And he didnâ€™t look happy. After time when his horse had made labor and foal grew up his son was riding fell from young horse and broke his leg. Doctor said that he would be lame all last life. What you think what our man said and what all his neighbors said. You will be right if you think that all neighbors regretted about this news and our man didnâ€™t again know it was bad or good. Time flights. And country where lived our hero had began the war. All young men from the village were taken to the army except lame gay. That was a reason why all mansâ€™ neighbors were envious for him. But a man was not worry. He said: â€œ I donâ€™t know thatâ€™s bad or goodâ€. This story hasnâ€™t the end. Because each event might be good or bad in the same time. It depends from the point of view to the life. So what do you think about this thought?

Russian,"Easy to chat and hard to speak? I use Skype very active, especially for speaking with relatives or friends. But I've noticed, that some people prefer to chat rather than to speak. I knew, that people are divided into 3 groups of the way they perceive information: by hearing, writing and loooking. I s'pose, that I do it better by hearing, cos I used to play piano for many years and only way to learn big music works is to play it many times and listen to it often. So. About Skype. I like to speak on Skype cos I can hear the voice, and a few people can control their voice. Facial expressions - may be. But voice - harder. I endeavor to do it, especially when I speak to not familiar people to me, or with those, who are not friendly to me. You can guess about emotions of your companion and true feelings. You can hear second sense in their words. BUT! When you chat, many things can be missed. And some people benefit from it. But I don't like it definitely!"

The best book I've read last year was ""The Notebook"" by Agota Kristof. Don't confuse it with ""The Notebook"" by Nicholas Sparks or with Agatha Christie. ;) In reviews this book is called ""the most pitiless book of the last century"". This is story of twins living with their grandmother's house in the Little Town during the WW II. But this books isn't about the War. It's story of two boys who adapt to the cryel world. They do special exercises to numb their feelings. This book isn't nice. It took us through all the dirt, bestiality, cruelty. Even I can't stadn such thing this book is the best book I've ever read. ""The Notebook"" is amazing thing and I strongly recomend you to read this. I wish I could see theatrical performance of ""The Notebook"". Have you read this book? Did you like it? What best book have you read last year?"
Russian,"Pelting rain Once again, practice in translation. It's raining in my town now, so the atmosphere is favourable. â€œPelting rainâ€ by Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol Damp, pelting rain was pouring when I left the house. Gray, smoky sky foreboded the rain to last. There was not even a ray of light; a gray veil with no tear in it. Moving net of the rain caught almost everything, that the eye had met before, and only houses on the front of the street flickered as if seen through gauze. Dimly flickered a sign upon a sign, even more dimly flickered balcony above them, and finally, one more floor higher, the roof almost lost in the rainy fog and only the watery shine slightly distinguished it from the air; water murmured in the pipes. Puddles on the pavement. Damn, I love times like this. Not a fellow on a street. Now there is not a sign of those gentleman, who stop to examine your boots, trousers, tailcoats or hat, and after that, with their mouths wide open, look back few times to scrutinize your derriere. Now I am free to wrap in the coat tightly. Look, some nice young lad, with a face you can easily shove into ladies' reticule, runs in vain hopes of saving his new frock-coat, the beauty and the loveliness of the whole Nevsky Prospect. Pour harder, rain, make him return home as wet as a rat. Ah, here's a grand dame running in her motley rags, dress is lifted up to the last point where the decencies allow, where has her temper gone? She doesn't mind when some bureaucrat in uniform with order, with his eyes as green as his uniform, staring at her obese thighs, trembling like a jelly at her every step. Oh, those bastards! They are aces, those bureaucrats, to catch a fish in a dirty water. Come rain, snow or sunny day- you will find this amphibian on a street. Every minute his collar changes its color with temperature just like chameleon, but he himself stays the same, like his bureaucratic procrastination. Here comes a Russian-beard, a merchant in a german blue frock-coat with waist somewhere on a back, or better, on the neck. With such a business grip he holds an umbrella above his mistress. How pants this pile of meat, wrapped in housecoat and cap. She can be classified rather as a mollusc than vertebrate animal. Rain harder, I beg you, rain on his german frock-coat and grease meat of this feather-bed inhabitant. God, what an awful smell of cabbage and onion they have left. Pour on them, rain, for their wickedness, for this beard's shameless trickery, for cupidity, for his beard full of lice and for his bestial mistress... Nonsense! They won't feel a policeman's punch, what raindrops can do. Anyway, we haven't had such rain for a long time. It became stronger, and now falls straight down as if trying to bring this marsh town lower to the ground. Windows of confectioner's shops are closed. Heads with mustaches and pipes, the last one to stand, hid. Even the gray knight with halberd and bandaged cheek hurried to his sentry box."

Russian,"about our life I didn't know how to title this note. I go to Business English courses. I like it,because there are some people whom I like very much. And our teacher is nice. And now we are studying the unit about stress and how to cope with it. I have studied English for a long time but at this courses I get a lot of new words. And here I want to tell you about my stress situations and how I overcome them. And I want to ask you about it. because in different counties there are different situations, and may be your advise will help me. So, at first I want to suggest some stressful situations. For example: going to the dentist, queuing in the supermarket, being stuck in a traffic jam, finding a place to park, having an interview, making a speech, traveling by air. As for me, I can't say that I am stressed out person. But we are living in such world where it is impossible to live without stress. I think that the most stressful situation for me is making a speech. I am always anxious about it. I always lick my lips and then they are not nice looking:) During the speech I can forget some words. It can be simply and very important word and it seems that I lost it and can't find. I think it looks funny to watch my speech. So I try to avoid any opportunity to have a speech. Now,I am finishing my note. I am looking forward your corrections and also your own opinion about stress."

Russian,"Home reading I'm having a special Home Reading lesson tomorrow. So I read a book. It's one of â€œQuick Readsâ€ books. And now I must write a synopsis. So I decided to write it here: A Dream Come True. Her name is Maggie. She works part-time for travel agency. She is forty three and she lives in Liverpool with her husband and their dog. His name is John. He is a teacher in school and he spends much time on the work. They haven't any children and he is the only person who called her by her full name Margaret. These are the facts influences onÂ a lot of facts in this book. In the beginning of the book she arrives to the conference in Brighton and mets there Connor. He is from Manchester, married with tree children. He's woks for travel agency too. But it was his own agency. It was, but both of their agencies is bought by the â€œBuzzâ€ corporation. It's a long time since people had told Margaret she is pretty. And now Connor has and she feels something new. May be it's not a love, but it's what can make a woman happy. They have a smashing time in Brighton. But it's time to go home. And Connor says he'll call and they'll meet one more time without fail. But let's talk about someone else. Because there are some other characters in book. And one of them is Maggie's boss, Hugh Miller. He is worried that he would lose his job because Buzz can employ their own staff at his agency. And his suspicions comes true. Felix Anderson, the founder of Buzz, chooses Maggie to be the manager in Buzz in Liverpool. But she decide to change her job. But it isn't the reason for Felix to make Hugh his employee. And one more about Hugh. He loves Maggie and he'll be one of the elements in her family tragedy.

She leaves home, when she is pregnant. And returns only with child, without child's father. And the last character in this book is Connor's wife Emma. She doesn't want to sacrifice her work to children. So they have some problems with their little boy, and it doesn't make their marriage happier. And now we return to Maggie's story. She has been waiting a call from Connor for a few days. And he calls. They meets in the restaurant in Liverpool while they spouses are busy. It isn't good rendezvous so Maggie decides that it is their last meeting. Then her relations with her husband gets cold. And ones he knows true. Hugh tells him about Maggie's relations with Connor.

Emma crashes the car and gets into hospital with their little Harry. Connor goes out. But it's all right with Emma and Harry and Connor and Maggie understands that he's goes out of her live forever. At the same time John turns out the bigger scoundrel than you can think. Maggie catches him with his lover in her mother's house.

Russian,"Embroidery Today I bought a present for my friend's birthday. Actually, her birthday was yesterday, but I knew I will meet her only tomorrow, so I decided to spend some more time choosing what to give her. In the end, I bought a book about embroidery in ribbons. [Is it correct to use ""in"" here? My dictionary has ""embroidery in silk"", but it doesn't say anything about the embroidery that uses ribbons as the material. ] She likes to make different handmade things, and she's really good at it, so I thoght she'd like the book. It has thorough instructions and various examples of embroideries. I never imagined that you can make such beautiful things with ribbons. (To tell the truth, I'm not good at needlework, even though we were taught it at school). Here are some pictures I found on the Internet. After seeing all the pictures in the book, I became very interested and thought that maybe I should try and make something myself..."
Russian,"Hallo! Guten Tag, die Benutzer von Lang-8. Das ist mein erster Eintrag auf diesem Website. Soweit ich verstehe, darf man hier um Hilfe mit der Sprache man lernt bitten. Eine wunderbare MÃ¶glichkeit, die gerade zur rechten Zeit gekommen ist! In einigen Tagen werde ich die PrÃ¼fung fÃ¼r Goethe-Zertifikat C1 auflegen. Um die zu bestehen versuche ich die Aufgaben von vorherigen Jahren zu machen. Eine von diesen ist immer Beschreibung einer Grafik. Ich wÃ¤re Ihnen Ã¤uÃŸerst dankbar, wenn sie diesen Text Ã¼berfliegen werden, um mich auf meine Fehler zu verweisen. (Dass der Umfang nicht eingehaltet ist weiÃŸ ich.) Auf jeden Fall lege ich auch die Grafik an. Darf man Ã¼brigens so kategorisch in der PrÃ¼fung schreiben? Ich bin keine Aktivistin fÃ¼r gleiche Rechte, ich hatte beim Schreiben einfach Angst davon, dass ich meine Gedanken nicht klar genug Ã¤uÃŸern werde. --- Die Grafik zum Thema â€žEinkommensunterschiede zwischen MÃ¤nner und Frauenâ€œ zeigt, wie viel Geld bekamen fÃ¼r ihre Arbeit MÃ¤nner und Frauen in Deutschland im Vergleich zur EU 1999 und 2004. Auf der Grafik ist besonders auffÃ¤llig, dass das Unterschied beim Einkommen von weiblichen und mÃ¤nnlichen Arbeitern in der EU allgemein in der Zeitperiod von 1999 bis 2004 sich weniger verÃ¤ndert hat, als in Deutschland. Es ist auch zu erkennen, dass im Unterschied zu Deutschland wurde in der EU die Durchschnittslohn von Frauen grÃ¶ÃŸer. Aus meiner Sicht ist diese Situation nicht zu tolerieren, deshalb beurteile ich positiv, dass in der EU allgemein die Arbeitsgeber die richtige Entscheidungen getroffen haben. Obwohl in der EU beginnen die Arbeitsgeber die Arbeit von Frauen und MÃ¤nnern gleich zu schÃ¤tzen, sind die BehÃ¶rde von Deutschland leider noch nicht genug tolerant, wie ich sie sehen mÃ¶chte. Meiner Meinung nach sind die Vorurteilen der alten Zeiten der Grund dieser Ungleichheit. Die MÃ¤nner einschÃ¤tzen die Vertreter anderes Geschlechts als irrationell, und deshalb glauben sie, dass eine Frau nie kompetent genug fÃ¼r ihres Amt sein kÃ¶nnte. Ich denke, dass diese Vorurteilen nicht mehr ein Teil modernes Leben sein darfen. Es wÃ¤re ganz nÃ¼tzlich, wenn objektive Statistik von Ergebnissen der weiblichen Beamten mitgeteilt wÃ¼rde, sodass die Arbeitsgeber keine Angst davon haben, einer Frau Arbeit zu geben. Leider ist der BevÃ¶lkerung von Lettland bekanntlich das bedauernswertes Wesen: die obenerwÃ¤hnte Vorurteilen bestehen noch in der Gesellschaft. Mann kann, z. B., in technischen Bereichen sehr oft von Situationen hÃ¶ren, wenn eine Frau eine kleinere Lohn bekommt, als ihrer Kollege im dieselben Amt. AuÃŸerdem absagen hÃ¤ufig die Arbeitsgeber, weibliche Spezialisten auszuwÃ¤hlen, und statt diese Frauen bekommen die Arbeit MÃ¤nner, die dieselbe Qualifikationen haben. AbschlieÃŸend mÃ¶chte ich sagen, dass die Tendenz, die EU demonstriert, Optimismus einflÃ¶ÃŸt, und wird dasselbe hoffentlich in allen LÃ¤nder Europas passieren."

Russian,"Island of Crimea By Vasiliy Aksenov Language, myths, legends and fairy tales are good sources of information for those who study collective unconscious archetypes. There is a very Russian word â€œÑ‚Ð¾ÑÐºÐ°â€ [taskAh] that means a melancholy and longing for something incomprehensible at the same time. And there is an old myth about the Buyan island, where there are a lot of magic things, eternal glory and, what is most important, an absolute justice for all. This island was the exact opposite to the miserable real life. So for centuries, Russian people had been planting in their hearts the longing for the ideal place. The Soviet Union was separated from the rest of the world by the iron curtain, so many Soviet people put their Buyan island to abroad, to the inaccessible capitalistic countries. My grandfather dreamed about visiting Paris one day, knowing pretty well that he would never cross the boarder of the Soviet Union. My parents, like many other Soviet people, used to think about the â€œWestern worldâ€ as about the land where everything is much better than in Russia, where the most poor guy has good clothes and tasty food, where houses are large and people are friendly and honest. The â€œWestern worldâ€ was their Buyan island. My generation has to find a new place to put our dream land on, because what is accessible, is no longer ideal. A Russian novelist Vasily Aksenov (Ð’Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð»Ð¸Ð¹ ÐŸÐ°Ð²Ð»Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ‡ ÐÐºÑÑ‘Ð½Ð¾Ð²) wrote the Island of Crimea in 1979. It was the time when Russian society lived in the world of double standards. The difference between the official propaganda and the real situation was schizoid-like. On the one hand, Soviet people condemned the capitalistic world for racism, exploitation and wrong moral principles, but on the other hand, many people dreamed about travelling to abroad and buying all those symbols of the bright life like jeans and tape recorders. Nowadays, we have everything available in our supermarkets, so my niece would hardly understand what does it mean â€” to dream about a pair of jeans. Aksyonov built his ""Island of Crimea"" on an interesting premise. What if Crimea were an island, instead of a peninsula. Further more, what if Crimea was the only area of Greater Russia to hold out against the Reds, and become a multy-ethnic ""free"" zone? It is not a novel of the alternative history, but a novel of alternative geography instead. The mythical Buyan Island was put into the Island of Crimea. So some limited amount of people got an opportunity to live in the conditions that they were dreaming about. Are they happy finally? Not at all. The Island enjoys capitalism (like Hong Kong), but many want to rejoin Russia. The brightest and the smartest Crimean people are petting the idea of the so called â€œCommon Fateâ€. Their hearts are longing for â€œthe Big Motherlandâ€, they consider their richness and happiness as false values and want to suffer as much as people behind the iron curtain. Also, there is a group of youngsters who want to have their own identity, a Russian-Tatar mix called Yaki. The society is splitting into conflicting groups, so instead of the Eden, they get Hell one day. The Island of Crimea is a perfect guideline to deceitful and seducing ideology of the Soviet Union. The book also contains a bitter and merciless portrait of a cast of almighty bureaucrats. Though the novel is more than thirty years old, a reader can find shocking similarity with the modern Russia, which is no longer under the iron curtain and no longer governed by communists, but is still playing with dangerous ideas and making same crucial mistakes time after time. I should add that the novel is very well written, its style is rich and its plot is intriguing. It is impossible to close the book once began reading. I would suggest this book to everybody who wants to learn more about Russia and its mysterious soul, but also I would suggest this book to my Russian friends, because forgetting history is making it repeating."
Russian,"Can anyone please translate? Hello! Can anyone please tell how the following concepts concerning education are called in English? 1. First of all, lectures and seminars at universities - how are they called together? Classes, like in school, or is there another word? 2. People from the same class in school are called classmates, and people from the same group at university? 3. After our third year at university we (my [classmates] and me) went to SAO - Special Astronomical Observatory situated near Caucasian mountains (and not far from my hometown ^^). Russia's largest telescope is situated there. We went there to see how the things we learned for three years at the university actually work, try doing something ourselves and so on. If I translate the Russian word used for this, it will be ""practice"", but when I asked a friend from Canada, he said that it's better to say ""job training"", but the latter is used when speaking about jobs. I'm not really sure, but can it be applied to my case? As far as I understand, studying at a university can't be called a ""job""... 4. And the last one. When you are writing your yearly essay or diploma, there's a professor who is helping and guiding you. In Russian he's called ""Ð½Ð°ÑƒÑ‡Ð½Ñ‹Ð¹ Ñ€ÑƒÐºÐ¾Ð²Ð¾Ð´Ð¸Ñ‚ÐµÐ»ÑŒ"", that can be translated as, err... something like ""scientific... instructor""? How do I say all that in English so that it sounds like something a native speaker would say? Thanks for all the answers in advance, and, as always, I'll appreciate it if you correct all the mistakes in the text above. It was a challenge to write it ^^"""
Russian,"Important things of a job It's not only money which person earns. The first aspect is that it makes you feel better whereas you simply doing your work. You receive a pleasure and that's all. I know a few people who have a poorly-paid job, for instance school teachers. They keep their desire to work so even if they don't obtain enough money, because of the love to children. The second thing is that you go to work due to your strong motives to improve your skills through practice, increase your knowledge and thus develop yourself as a personality. The third aspect is that you obtain sense of respect and recognition. And that is very significant for us. To conclude, I'd say that job can attract not only through salary, but through possibilities to gain another targets(purposes, which one is better(or may be: aims, gains, objectives)) as well."
Russian,"Music in our life. I think that it is difficult to live without music. We can hear music everywhere: in the streets, at home, over the radio... Teenagers like to listen to music,dance, play musical instruments. Music plays a very important role in our life, it reflects mood and emotions. Many young people are fond of folk music, modern music. Pop and rock music is also popular among young people. My joy is organ, rock and classical music."

In these places so mush dust and expositions havenâ€™t been being changed for years :) I want to tell you about last exhibition which I visited. â€˜The desert is not silentâ€™ â€“ Libyan arts and artist. Desert is 90 per cent of Libya. In spite of this artists uses all bright colors for describing their motherland. It was really interesting for me because until recently contemporary art of Libya had been inaccessible to the international community In one hall visitors could saw the antique art of Libya and in other hall - the contemporary art. Iâ€™ve added one picture. Artist Saif Al Islam M. Al Qadhafi (How are they remember so long name? :) The title is Â« the Sun of the OasisÂ». In real life colors are more vivid then on this picture. Do you like exhibitions? How do you prefer to spent your free time?"

Russian,"Trainspotting. To watch something with Scottish accent I was recomended to watch ""Trainspotting"". I have very contrary impression from this film. The film is full of horrible and disgusting scenes, vulgar and repulsive parts, all this drug stuff. But it's impossible to stop watching it. I think this film must be showed to all teens to explain them what ""get into bad company meaned"". I was really impressed with the part where main character refuse frome drugs, remove to London, start to work, but then his friends come and everything roll down again. Soundtrack is great, actors' play is briliant, topic is very sharp. But film isn't about drugs, it's about choice. For me the main idea was if you overcome yourself and will work hard you'll be able toget on train to the better life. It's shoved very clear how all characters bring their lifes to the last line. So the moral is - choose life. P. S. The quote about consumer society is great. P. P. S. Ð¡lose-cut and skinny Ewan McGregor looks gorgeous. But his character is unattractive anyway."

Russian,"I've been to Syprus. Today I went back from Syprus. It was amazing and boring at the same time. Amazing because I've known quite different culture. Boring because I've travelled with my father only. Spend your holiday without any people of your age is boring enough. But when I was sitting in a plane I was tried to calm myself that I could meet somebody like me and spend time together. Alas, I was mistaken. The place where we arrived was just a backwoods. There weren't any teenagers like me, only families with small children. Ok, I tried to calm down myself again. One really good news was that the beach was public. I thought my calls were heared by God..... No. Every day one group of Germans played volleyball, I asked to common with them and they agreed. There were two teenagers: girl-Billy and boy-Louise. Everything went OK, before Billy asked where I'm come from. When I said Russia, Billy had a normal reaction, but Louise has started to behave strange. He didn't notice me any more, it was unpleasently for me, so I wasn't very sad when they left the hotel. I still canâ€™t understand why he did that. Unlikely, it was because Iâ€™m Russian. Perhaps he just didnâ€™t like me and thatâ€™s all. On the other side it got more boring after their county. Every day you go on the beach like on work. Ordinary sunbathing and swimming bore you at first few days and you need something new. I decided to try a diving. My instructor was friendly , he always kidding and smiling me. Iâ€™m new in diving, so our immersion was no far of the beach. It was fantastic, despite that all view was grey and there werenâ€™t such a big diversity of colours like in Egypt or Austrelia. But I enjoyed every second. I had liked it so much that decided to go again. So, first half of my holydays was flatly, but few last days were more interesting than previous."
Russian,"a kind of insomnia:)London desire! I've just realised that I don't want to sleep. My main wish for today is to get my UK Visa as soon as possible. I hope this August will be wonderful. I want to get some new experience and emotions. London is a city of dream. In Russia it's often called Vanilla city. It may come as a suprise for you,but nowadays there is some kind of new subculture in Russia,aka Vanilla girls,haha. The example of member of this movement is a girl,who likes rain,coffee,smoking cigarettes,looking out of the window,thinking about HIM and wearing I love (NY,LONDON,PARIS)t-shirts. Personally,I think these girls are ridiculuous and their attitude to life is too childish,It is so stupid to copy someone's style!So,returning to England,I can say it is a nice country with excellent traditions. I can call it the country of conservatism. By the way,street fashion in London is exciting. Hope to be there soon"
Russian,"please, help me with the translation it happened so: ""By the end of January 1999 russian unemployment rate reached a record high 12,4 per cent of economically active population size. In December Russian State Committee for Statistics had evaluated unemployed rate in country at the rate of about 11,8 percent of amount of human resources (amount of labor force). In January overall rate of jobless, who was looking for work soever (through advertising, friends, labor exchange) and who was ready to begin work, to amount to 8 million 956 thousand in Russia. For all showings, this being the situation of young employment has more negative apperrances, then being the situation of whole population in the country. The percentage of young people among jobless overrides in one and a half time the amount of youngs among employed people. School-leavers, graduating students from colleges, secondary and high universites to amount to about a quarter (23,8 percent) of jobless youngs at the age of 16-29. The problem of job placement for unnecessary graduatings must be solved. But more reasonable is to try to minimize the inflow of them in the crowds of jobless. Lets consider the problem by example high school. The liquidation of assising college graduates to jobs led to changing all system of relationship between students, institutes, business and state. Some ""vacuum of responsibility"" was appeared. Employment for graduatings don't belong to functions of placement service untill they get unemployment status. Employment for graduatings don't belong to functions of institutes (universites)."" Correct my horrible mistakes, pleeeeease:)"

Russian,"Literature nowadays Can you tell me, what is the situation nowadays with the literature in your countries? Is there any interest to fantasy, science fiction, love stories, history novels and etc.? Of course I have heard about hits, but I'm more interested in 'underground'. You can fell free to ask me everything in that theme as well."
Russian,"Art I love reading books. Not only that, but any art: painting, cinema, music etc. I myself try to write tales and it seems to me that sometimes I do it quite well. Actually, I devour much art almost every day, I watch films, read books, listen to the music, watch pictures and write on my own. I can say there are two main interests in my life, spiritual practice and art. In the modern world most of people people donâ€™t give consideration to art. Sure, there are TV-show and pop-music, but most of people know nothing about anything else. Iâ€™m not sure that it all happens just now and didnâ€™t happen before, but if you look at old books which were published in USSR youâ€™ll find that numbers of copies were huge. Some numbers of copies came up to 250 000. If you look at books which were published now, youâ€™ll find that their numbers of copies are just a few thousands. Whatâ€™s the reason? Iâ€™m not really sure. Can in be television? I suppose, it certainly can. The thing is television is a very simple thing to watch and itâ€™s simple to become addicted to it. I know that most of people who are over 30 spend almost all their float if front of a TV set. They come from work and the first thing they do is turning a television on. The present generation prefers other things to do, but they are as simple and provoke dependence just like TV. Iâ€™m not being preachy, I just think itâ€™s quite a valuable thing to think about. P. S. In last posts Iâ€™ve been trying to make many mistakes:) Sure, itâ€™s not an end in itself, I just try to do what I canâ€™t do and learn something new from it."
Russian,"Some more writing practice Yesterday this site wasn't available for me and I don't know why. Yesterday another site wasn't available for one of my American friends. The day before yesterday still another site wasn't available. Do I have the right to say that the world is coming to its end since lots of sites don't work properly? I am definitely into learning Italian. It's such a pleasure to learn a foreign language! I don't remember the days of my childhood when I was a pupil and I had to do my homework. If I had had all the possibilities to learn a foreign language I have today my English wough have been perfect. - lol I have been learning English since my school years but I can't say I have a natural command of it. The reason is, at least as I see it, that I lack communication. Though I spend much time on reading, writing and listening, I feel I have a want of real, live speaking. There is an opportunity to speak in the Internet but I don't believe in its value. I am not sure I can enrich my English by talking to a person whom I don't know and about topics that I don't care. Travelling might be considered the best way out in case I have had enough money. Grazie mille! Arrivederci!"

Russian,"Srinagar and Mountain Road February, 2010. Our point of destination was Gulmarg, the little village thirteen kilometers - six point two miles â€“ from the Pakistan border, but before was Srinagar. We were landing into snow and rain. In the airport there was no police, only military. Our cell phones didn't work because a cellular network was allowed only for locals by authority of military. It was the separatist region contended by Pakistan. On the parking lot there were mix of water and snow around cheap off-road vehicles with chains over worn tires. TATA is a dominant auto brand and severe low-cost. Local guys kept our stuff on a rack really quick. They wore sneakers or rubber boots, loose overalls made with sacking; hat was not at everyone. It was still wet snow fall. We got on the vehicle and went through a city. Houses around were rough construction, some of them were tumbledown. There were a lot of trash around, dust and slush; almost everyone wore a sacking loose overall. Many military motorcades were coming in the opposite direction; every truck had a couple machine gunners on the top. Our TATA, knocking the chains upon puddle snow, went high and high in the mountings. The rain gave way to the heavy snowfall, really heavy snowfall. The serpentine road went through steep descents overgrown with pine forest; massive trees slowly disappear from our views behind the wall of snowfall."

Russian,"Yoga I practice yoga more than five years. I'm too lazy to do something at home regularly so I prefer to attend yoga class at the club. Yoga is very popular now so there are a lot of yoga classes and it's hard to find a teacher who will be good for you. My previous yoga teacher has been teaching me for about 4 years. In the beginning I liked her style very much. I noticed a progress in my practice and everything was going well. Then I became very tired of her and practice didn't bring me pleasure anymore. Fortunately or not, a couple of months ago the club was closed. Now I attend another club not far from home. It's very convenient because it takes me only 5 minutes to get there on foot. I was very lucky to find a good yoga teacher here! He's a very positive guy and I feel myself so relaxed after the practice. Even if in the beginning I'm a little bit nervous after a whole day at the office I find a very good mood during the practice."

Russian,"Odessa The day when we arrived to Odessa was cool but sunny. The City day was celebrated this day and we decided to watch the performance instead of walking along the streets. Next day decided to make a â€œcaneâ€ trip of a tram #20 that ends in the Hadzhibeevskiy estuary. There are two tram on the route and both of them look more threadbare than those in the center of the city. The trip has its name because the old line passes straight through the canes and thickets. Therefore there is a feeling of a trip through the jungle. At the estuary were many fishermen. Next day - the city. The place that you must visit is the Deribasivskaya street. For a short time here you can see the most common types of the townspeople, unless, of course, to try to distinguish them from the many tourists. Having seen enough on the parties, it is possible to take a break. If you walk through Deribasovskaya street to the City garden, take a look at the Cafe Klarabara - there is an amazing meat. No matter what kind of meat is: chicken, pork, beef, veal or lamb. The main thing is that it will be juicy and flavorful. If you want to taste the rich fruit shake, then go to the Greek restaurant â€œPapa Kostoâ€ that is on the Greek street. Stroll through the Teschin bridge that connects the Primorskiy and Komsomolskiy boulevards and stretches along the Black Sea. This is a place of pilgrimage not only for tourists but also, perhaps, for all married couples of the city. In the evening you can stand on the 192-th step of the Potemkin stairs, which, according to the guidebook, is included in the top five ladders in Europe. Go down and get to the marina and a port which is bright in the afternoon and soft-lighted in the evening. Another ""trip"" is a walk along the coast, through beaches and park alleys. Do not miss a case to ask the direction of passersby, who will necessarily fall on the road: everyone necessarily will show the road and, perhaps, will tell something interesting ""for Odessa."" Go down to the water through the old streets, but do it slowly, looking at the colorful interior of the courtyards, where there will wait at least five well-fed cats; go into the entrances, keep an eye to detail, and you will discover a beautiful, cinematic, dilapidated and vintage Odessa. Well, that's the sea."

Russian,"Fast foods in the UK Two graphs present the data on fast foods in Britain, as weekly expenditure and the trends of consumption, accounted in grams per week. As can be seen, the high income and average income groups preferred hamburgers, which underwent a sharp popularity increase from under 100 gr to 550 over 20 years. The first group spent on hamburgers over a half of the fast-food-money, that is, about 43 pence, while the second paid out 34 pence. The most popular in 1970 (300 gr) and the least consumable in 1990 (220 gr), was fish and chips, the expenditure on which among high and low incomers was equal. Both groups spent nearly one fifth of a pound weekly. Although in 1990 the British ate 200 gr more pizzas than in 1970; pizza was least buyable within all income groups. Overall, fast foods became more popular, especially hamburgers, which were preferred mostly by high and average incomers."
Russian,"How to speak about yourself? I have two questions: 1. Can I call the person whom I will love someday, I will not able to live without him, I want him to be my husband â€“ my future half or second half, or my half, or my close person? 2. Could you check my translation? I adore to travelling, seeing other people, their customs, to get acquainted with their culture, going sightseeing. I like different kind of music, I like music with rhythm you can dance to. And in my spare time I dance. Creative constituent â€“ that is attractive for me. I self-express in dance. According as mood, emotional state or what I want to reach (to be relaxed, sprightly, to get high mood) â€“ I dance to certain music. To my weaknesses I can relate a self-criticism. There are situations when I donâ€™t reach my purpose (aim). And this influences me, I clearly feel my own failures. I donâ€™t like it and in the future I will not commit the same mistakes. Some of my acquaintances relate my maximalism to my drawbacks. Although not all think so because they are the same people who aim at winning and do not recognize failures. I think that on the one hand this trait helps, and on the other hand it limits. Thatâ€™s why I am trying to not so critical relating to myself and to receive as much benefit from my failures as I can. I try to manage myself. We all have unique traits to our personality. When these traits are suppressed or unrealized, problems will arise. So, thatâ€™s why study (examination) yourself is so important (relevant, significant). I try to search the true reason of difficulties and problems and destroy it. I have a strong belief (conviction) â€“ do manage yourself (work over yourself) in order to develop your positive qualities and destroy negative ones."

Russian,"Lucky day! )) A few days ago I finally bought a book I was searching for about half a year or maybe more. It was published in 2005, and I didn't think I'll find it in bookstores. But some days ago my friend and I were walking by a little bookstore and decided to go inside just to see if they have anything interesting. And - there it was, standing on the shelf in front of me, one last book of this series, and exactly the one I needed. It was definitely my lucky day)) This book is the first volume of the series called ""ÐŸÐ»Ð¾Ñ…Ð¸Ñ… Ð»ÑŽÐ´ÐµÐ¹ Ð½ÐµÑ‚"" (hmm... ""There are no bad people"", maybe?) by two Russian authors. It has Chinese name, too: é›œæ°£å…‹çŽ‹ æ²¡æœ‰å£žäºº (hope I didn't make mistakes here). Its genre is alternative history. I like the people described in that book, there really are no bad people, even though main characters are always chasing some criminals (it's a detective story too). It's some kind of utopia I'd like to live in :)"

Russian,"Another attempt to master a business news slang When one uses a lot of professional slang and makes familiar words sound weird, we call it ""a bird language"" in Russian. To my taste, business news are written in a bird language. I suspect, the slang here is preferable over the normal language for the targeting reason -- these news are addressed to those who understand this slang. Any slang distinguish ""us"" from ""them"". So, I'm trying to master the business news slang. Here is the news translated by me: The largest Russian handset retailer Euroset published the preliminary non-GAAP diluted quarterly report for the first quarter 2010. Euroset reported 1Q2010 sales in units up 27.6% year on year that amounted to 2.36 mln. Eurosetâ€™s sales in Rubles increased by 8.7% and amounted to 13.8 bl Rubles. â€œThe significant retail price decrease for Nokia hurt our revenue,â€ Eurosetâ€™s CEO Alexander Malis said. Nokiaâ€™s market share in Russia is about 40%-42%. During the first quarter, large retail chains initiated the price war and drop retail prices for Nokia down that resulted in loss of margin. Eurosetâ€™s IPO is expected in 2011. The retailerâ€™s market share is 34% in Russia. Your help is highly appreciated :)"
Russian,"The film summary ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" The film shows us a story of a young man, who had received the invitations to the weddings one after another. Every time he is late and every time he played jokes on the groom and bride. On the first wedding he met a pretty woman with whom he fell in love, but he didnâ€™t want to admit it. When the wedding was over, his friend and he went home but suddenly he changed his mind and went to the hotel where young lady stayed. He found her hiding between chairs from one man. Then she asked him to follow her. They slept together and then we saw another scene. There was another wedding, and young boy didnâ€™t change his habits. Again he met a young woman but unfortunately she wasnâ€™t alone. She introduced her fiancÃ© to the boy. When they have gone a boy felt a disappointment as he understood that he lose his happiness. The third wedding was, as we can understand, a wedding of this woman and her fiancÃ©. It was an unusual one, based on the Scottish traditions. During the speech of fiancÃ©e an accident had happened. The best friend of the main character died. After the wedding, there was a funeral. The young man had a conversation with his best friend, in which they discussed the sense of weddings. The young boy understood that he lost his sweetheart so he had some doubts about marriage. after a few month of this talking we saw another scene. The forth marriage was the marriage of this boy. He married a girl who loved him and they went out for some time but he understood that he didnâ€™t love her as much as it should be. Then he met his sweetheart, who said that she and her husband broke up. The boy was thinking about it. He made the right decision and, with the help of his brother, he ruined the wedding. So he asked this girl to marry him. In the end there were photos which show us that all friends of this boy get married and it proved that everyone should find his own half."
Russian,"Walk in Saint Petersburg Today I want to tell you about my city. I am live in Saint Petersburg near metro station ""Ploshad Mygestva"". This station are not situated in center of the city, but I very often go to center for walkin on beautiful streets. Many Peterburg's streets save some especial historical form. Little courtyards, narrow streets buildings from 19 century surrounded you and can movie you in this fantastic time. And a lot of cars, shops and coffe houses can't break this illusion.

Thai,"Contrast paragraph I try to write a contrast paragraph but I'm not sure with punctuation and grammatical. If there are any mistakes, please help. Travelling in your country is different from travelling abroad for many reasons. First of all, when you travel abroad, you usually spend a lot of money. It is more expensive than travelling in your country because you need to pay for air ticket, food and accommodation. In addition, you need to prepare a lot of thing such as passport, visa and winter clothes if you go to cold country. Travelling might take some time but you can have a new experience also. However, when you travel in your country, you donâ€™t need to spend that much. You also donâ€™t need passport or visa. It is comfortable but you might not experience many different things. Both travelling in your country and travelling abroad are good but you should consider your trip carefully if you have a limited money."
Thai,"Practice 1 Iâ€™m trying practice writing for my exam. Please help me to check this writing. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the International music that is heard everywhere nowadays? Music is widespread in many countries. In fact, all the countries have it. Many reasons for people in each country need music. Firstly, people used musical to play for respect god or anything else that they respect; spirits, nature and etc., they thought song will make that satisfy and bless them to happy life. Although, we play it at church now. Next, music can influence people to enjoy and have energy, therefore musicians played it in events, festivals and parties. Finally, some music can relieve stress, so it is brought to heal and knows as music therapy, which can hear in hospital, school or home. In the other hand, music can divide in 2 parts; traditional music and international music. Traditional music is identify country music that people can know where are songs from. Unlike, international music is music that accepts all over the world. Some countries, traditional music is less play in present than the past and difficult to hear. In conclusions, we need music to play for respect Jesus, enjoy in events and therapy. In addition, we should to keep traditional music before it will lose because it is important due to it is identity in each country more than international music that can hear in many country.

Thai,"Traffic problem in Bangkok (revised) Traffic problem in Bangkok The increasing number of cars on the roads of Bangkok each day has a very significant impact on the life of the residents. What will happen assuming that in the future everyone has a car? Compared to the past car buying is very simple today. Car Company uses a variety of techniques to persuade customers to buy a car. With attractive promotions such as free first-class insurance, payment by installments with 0% interest for the first three years including free options and a specified warranty. It becomes obvious that everyone can afford to have a car of their own. Even though Bangkok now has Sky train Subway and Bus Rapid Service (BRT), the mass transports systems are mostly under construction and still do not cover the ultimate areas. This unfortunate situation causes the number of cars on the roads to increase continuously and, as everyone is aware, the traffic congestion during the prime time in Bangkok is still unsolved. Another aspect of importance is the fact that many motorists have ignored the duty to oblige to the traffic laws. I think the government should give priority to solving the existing traffic problem by formulating new policies with potential. In summary a policy should be created whereby people are encouraged to commute by forming car pools or using public transport as alternatives to facilitate their travelling, thus reducing the number of cars on the roads."

Thai,"Japanese movie Today I watched the Japanese story from VCD, The story was about a woman cartoonist who raised the orphant cat named ""Sawa"". Her cat had been sicked and died. She decided to have a new one from pet store and he was very lovely. Finally, she could not take care him after she knew that she got cancer. She felt guilty about the former cat and dream to meet him for making apologize. The story didn't complicate, it's simply but it's not easy for us to understand the Japanese emotion and character from the story. I found that many Japanese cartoons are quite fun to read, I can imagine from the drawing unlike the story movie. Have you had any idea when you viewed Japanese movie? I like Japanese Horror more anyting else since it didn't need any explanation."

She travelled to study in English language course for one year. She had been met with her English boyfriend while both was watching movie in the theater. He was older than herselves and lived as a driver in London city. The story wrote the girl attitude through couple life, love, family from Eastern culture. While the man dreamed about coutry house and want to live in farm, the girl would like to use brain for work not the strength. She liked to eat meat while he was vegetarian. He let her travel to European country for broaden her view, while she only though about going back to London home. Western man needed Eastern girl to stay alone and have space with him. But she could not understand him. It was fun story that the English man can imagin how the young Eastern will be.

It's a good story."

Thai,"My Experience of Finding Money When I Was A Child (Please anyone help me correct my next quiz) Most people start finding money after they graduate from university, but there are some people who don't accept that, including me. I'll share with you about experience of finding money when I was young. When I was in elementary education, toy guns were very popular among boys, so I decided to start my first business by selling plastic bullet. I started to collect bullets from the ground, wash and packed them into a match box. Then I went to sell them among my friends at school, the price is ten pills per bath. The business didn't go well, but I still earned some money. A few days later, one of my friends came and showed me a plastic bag of numerous bullets. He said it costed him just five bath to buy at a shop, which is very very cheaper than mine. I awared that he knew the source, so I decided to close my business instantly. Even though it wasn't successful, but it's always sweet when I think about. There are a few methods that I used to find money but write them all here would be too long. Thanks for taking the time to read my story. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is my preparation for the next quiz on Friday.

Thai,"leave of absence Yesterday my colleage has been asked me about one word ""à¹ƒà¸šà¸¥à¸²"" I try to find the English again then no one in my office know how to use it. I kept this question in my mind until today. One of my senior help me to find the appropiate word for this. It is leave of absence, when I learn the new idiom or compound word, my colleage also told me that many Americans used AWOL to this situation, too. I just reconized this word after long time ago when I spoke it in my primary school English class, I was absence in that day. When I was young I also learn chinese language, unfortunately I could not reconize much now. My chinese teacher always provide us daily homework, Monday is chinease character writting, Tuesday is sentence composition from given word. The big Friday or long vacation we have to write an assay to send for our teacher on Monday. Monthy our teacher will pick up the best writing to show other student how better it was. My way of learning the new word is trying to writing that word in the sentence and remember preposition"" of, in, with.. How English use this preposition, do you use common sence or have a rule? Our preposition ""à¸—à¸µà¹ˆ"" ""à¸‹à¸¶à¹ˆà¸‡"" ""à¸­à¸±à¸™"" also doesn't use any rule we learn it form listening so we know which one should be used in each sentense. I empower my friend who learn Thai use a lot these preposition, and you will learn from it."

Thai,"Appreciate or love Last week I have one feeling in my emotion, appreciate? or love?... this two words seem different to my mind. I have never known its meaning, love?, once I had been asked from someone about love emotion. It looks doubt to me. Because I don't think that I can love anyone more than myself. People who is single will develope his own way of life to love himself, this feeling can give us security to spend lonely life. while appreciate sounds less emotion than love, I often conclude my feeling to everything in my life to appriciate status more than love status. Can somebody explain this two feeling in other meaning? I thought that appreciate could not change somebody habits but love can did it. When ""Love"" is sharing, I would like to say that ""appreciate"" is viewing. When ""Love"" is giving, I would like to say that ""appreciate"" is accepting. and what's your status to lang-8?"

Thai,"bonding Everyone has a bonding in their daily life. To live with family, pet or lover can make us feel sensitive when they have to change status. It's hard to make our own mind that everything is dynamic. A son would like to stay in a private dormitory or a daughter will marry with a strange man. A single pet owner, the pet will has a strong bonding with the owner. In contrary to family, pet doesn't seek for their private place, even female cat get pregnant she always walks back home with kitten. When our beloved family passed away we have a great sorrow, similar feeling can happened either to pet owner so the pet owner try to take care their elderly pet with prescription diet to lengthen life. Bonding is the invisible hand to help the crisis."

Thai,"Chapter 1 - Tragedy (III) Before I could do anything, I felt that something sharp piercing at my neck and at the same time, I felt the coldness of the knife pierced at my stomach. Then I heard the crack from my neck followed by the manâ€™s growling. â€œWHAT DID YOU DO, Cynthia?â€ I fell onto the ground and pretended that I was dead. â€œHer existence will bring great danger to our kind.â€ I knew that it must be the woman with black hair who said this because her voice was different from the blonde or I could say it was different from any other voice I had ever heard. Her voice was like the charm which can seduce everyone till I didnâ€™t know whether it was her voice which seduced me to believe that I would put the great danger to them or it was my intention from the first sight of the blood on their clothes which I knew exactly that it once belonged to my family. â€œHow could a girl like her possibly do any harm to us, Gypsy?â€ The grey-eyed man groaned. â€œAll I know is that her life must be taken.â€ said the black hair woman. And before the grey-eyed man could say anything, she said, â€œOr may be you want me to tell Adrian whatâ€™s going on here. Is that what you want or will you just burn this damn house and get out with no harm done.â€  â€œCome on, Derek. There are lots of girls like this out there.â€ One of the twins said but I didnâ€™t know whether it was Keith or Kenneth. â€œFine, what else can I do? Sheâ€™s dead. And Cynthia, if you dare threat me again, prepare yourself for the consequences.â€  â€œI apologize, my lord. It wonâ€™t happen again.â€ â€œGood.â€ â€œWhat will we do with the twins?â€ This time I didnâ€™t really know who was speaking because I was feeling like my body was burning and it was about to explore in a minute. I wanted to stand up, ran, scream or do anything to stop the pain but I couldnâ€™t. I know that there was a chance that I could save my sistersâ€™ lives. â€œLeave them here and burn the house. Youâ€™ve already killed my appetite. Iâ€™m out of hereâ€ Someone (who I assumed that it was Derek) said. â€œAs you wish, my lord. Keith, second floorâ€™s yours. Iâ€™ll burn this floor.â€ I still didnâ€™t know who said this but I knew only that he was having so much fun with it. I didnâ€™t know how long it had passed till I saw the fire was everywhere. I grabbed my head and turned it to the right direction. My clothes and the carpet on the floor were strained with my blood but my wound was no longer bleeding. I got up trembly as I still felt that every inches of my body was burning. I grabbed Amelia and Anitaâ€™s hands and went to the dinning room where my mum had told me before I reached here that the party was set there. I just hoped that someone might have survived. When I reached, what I saw make me want to scream on and on till there was no sound left in my throat but what I could do was pressing my teeth at my hand as hard as I could till I tasted my own blood. My mum was lying lifeless on the dinning table, her eyes wide opened. There were at least 3 wounds at her neck, the wounds which were not bleeding anymore. Her skin was so pale like there was no blood left in her body. My brother was there at the corner of the room, lifeless with eyes wide opened and several wounds at the neck as my mum. At first, I didnâ€™t see my dadâ€™s face because he faced down on the floor with one hand that reached to my mumâ€™s direction. I kneed next to him and turned him over with hope that he may has survived but again it was just a hope I already knew that it would never become true. I kissed my dad at his forehead for the last time and took my sisters out at the back door as fast as I could as the fire had reached us."

Chiang Mai is the real tourist city right now. We could see many cars from Bangkok and other provinces.

Before I came to Japan, I love studying English so much. I tried reading novels in English, writing diaries in English and watching series. I think these ways make me understand the real English that the native speakers use and make me able to use English naturally.

So, I feel the crisis that I have to review it now or I won't be able to fulfill my dream of speaking English fluently in the future. So please help me studying English. And if you need some helps with Thai, don't hesitate to ask me. I'd be happy to help you too."

The elephants is a wonderful creature and very very kind (not when it has gone mad but that rarely happens.) The sad thing about elephants in Thailand is that there's some people who bring elephant to the city and asked people's charity to feed them by buying food from the owner. Instead of living in the forest where they belong, they were dragged to the city and sometimes got hit by a car. Another problem is I don't know how to deal with that when I found one. If I don't buy the food, I'm afraid that the elephant will be hungry and if I buy it, this thing will never stop. What do you think?"
Thai,I Brewed a Cup of Coffee Again I brewed four cup of coffees today. In cause I would like to practice how to brewed a cup of coffee.

Thai,"Songkran Festival / Water Festival http://lh5.ggpht.com/_iNnd0o5w1pY/Sae1H606b1I/AAAAAAAAAYw/4x-lT29otWc/s800/26-02-2009_04K.gif Many people around the world know that this period of the year is called â€˜Songkran Festivalâ€™. Today, Iâ€™d like to tell some history and information to you. Songkran Festival are during 13th and 15th April in every year. April is the hottest month in Thai, and water is the best thing to relieve hot. So this festival came from this. Moreover, Thai belived in ancestor thankfulness. We beg for our ancestorâ€™s bless. Everytime we want moral support, we beg for our parents and ancestorâ€™s bless. Watering our parents is a way to show your thankfulness. So, we use water to be as a representative of good thing (à¸¨à¸´à¸£à¸´à¸¡à¸‡à¸„à¸¥). The first day of Songkran is called â€˜MaHaSongKran day (à¸§à¸±à¸™à¸¡à¸«à¸²à¸ªà¸‡à¸à¸£à¸²à¸™à¸•à¹Œ)â€™. This day is Thai New Year, so we usually make merit. Almost village have a place to meet and make merit together. In Thai, almost every village have at least one temple. We have many way to make merit. ^^ Starts from giving foods to monks, then praying, and then watering the image of Buddha. After praying, the president of all monks give â€˜holy water (à¸™à¹‰à¸³à¸¡à¸™à¸•à¹Œ)â€™ to every body. Many people who used to come to Thailand may know that. ^^ http://www.thanapol.com/moowaanza/newhome/KOM_1770.jpg After the ceremony at the temple (or the village), we come back home to water our senior relatives. Since the afternoon until the evening, children go to play water. There are many places depend on each person interesting. As many know, if you are in Bangkok, you must go to KhaoSarn Road (à¸–à¸™à¸™à¸‚à¹‰à¸²à¸§à¸ªà¸²à¸£). If you are in Southern part, you must go Phuket. If you are in middle part (but not in Bangkok), you must go to NakornSriAyuthaya (à¸™à¸„à¸£à¸¨à¸£à¸µà¸­à¸¢à¸¸à¸˜à¸¢à¸²). If you are in North, ChiangMai is the most famous place. And if you are in North East, there are many provinces and each province has their unique ceremony. The next day, 14th April, is also named in Thai. But I think itâ€™s quite difficult, and not many people know. I believe that some Thai people donâ€™t knowâ€¦ haha So donâ€™t mention it ^^â€ I just want to say that after we make merit on the first day of festival, we usually go somewhere to rest or travel. Itâ€™s depend on each family. Almost family go travelling together. In order to support family activities, the government named the festival as â€˜Family festival(à¸§à¸±à¸™à¸„à¸£à¸­à¸šà¸„à¸£à¸±à¸§) /Older person festival(à¸§à¸±à¸™à¸œà¸¹à¹‰à¸ªà¸¹à¸‡à¸­à¸²à¸¢à¸¸)â€™ This festival takes 3 days off, so it almost the work days (5 days per week,right?). Many people asked for absence to have a long vacation. Use only 2 days absence but get about 9 days off !! Anyway, the government support that in order to make family warmer and to boost our economy too! For me, this time, I havenâ€™t have a plan to go watering anywhere ^^â€. I have only one plan to make merit and water my senior relatives. Anyway, itâ€™s long vacation. I may plan day by day â€¦ eiei And something I have to not forget is BOSS2 on this Thursday nightâ€¦ hahaâ€¦ I hope that I can make you imagine this festival easier. If not, come to our smile Thailand >__< And let me know if anyone need help when you are here ^^ PS... How can I show images during my writing?"

Thai,"Terrible Internship Experience Last month, I began my internship as a third year undergraduate with one of the most famous English tutorial schools in Thailand. During my interview, the atmosphere was so stressful and competitive. The interviewers ask us [18 interviewees including me] to come up with an idea of a new product and the marketing strategy to make it outstanding. It was like I was going to be a marketer!!!! I was really surprised but not nervous because I takes International Business Management at the university. There had been 2 interviews before I got the internship program. Unlike what I expected, I am not here to learn any single skill or talent useful for future career life but to use the skills I already possess. It is unbelievable that such a famous English tutorial school, with more than 60 branches and 30,000 students nationwide, would have only 4-5 academic officers to make the course. Guess what? All of them gave me their jobs to complete. Moreover, the new employees who had just come to work only 2 weeks told me to finish his work of 19 page translation within 2 weeks. And to compose 17 English vocabulary poems for SAT course. I was and still be infuriated with the way they treat internship student. I got only 100 Baht per day, which is about 3 dollars a day! The only thing which holds me here is the extra money that the academic executive told me she would give. That's all I have for my entry this week. Thanks a bunch if you are willing to correct it for me!"

Thai,"The first week of work on 4 July 2011. It was fun to work in the same place that I have done before. It was nice to get to know the new colleagues there too, even if they were a lot of groups in there. First day, I started to work only one Thai teacher greeted me. And the second day, when I was in the office and wanted to talk with teacher who teach on Friday. Another question shot me again ""were you a new TT?"" I said I wasn't because I've worked here and returned again. Then two of them 'Wai' at me. That a shame that they were listening while I was talking with another. It seemed like Thai proverb-anybody can hear by door and window. And first Friday, it was a test of students that they need to listen the conversations. There was some speaking test too. Some of them have done very well. I thought one of colleauge that I talked these day really like me in the past like a mirror refect what I still said 3 years ago about the job we did. One thing is about good treat if it is enough, it would be okay. But it is still so on and on. Even if the world changes, the human never change."

Thai,"This Tree of Liberty Thomas Jefferson once said ""The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants,"" yet I saw a ton of blood watering this tree for decades and nothing but tyrants rise. Here, in Thailand, there were so many uprising of freemen against the conspired caste system which rooted deep and firm in this country since the very long time ago. When the fight ends, we, citizens, always lie to ourselves that the genuine democracy is at hand and there will be no more innocent's blood to be spilled, no more life to be taken, no more scream to be heard, and no more gun to be fired at the mass fleshes moving on the road, calling for their rights. Why it is always the blood of democracy-hunger that must pile all over the places, why not those tyrants'? Why the cold-blood murders who slaughter people like animals can get away without any taint? Or in this country, people like us worth no more than the bullets our taxes paid? This country can go on without us, the working class who just want to have our own leader? To whom ever concerned, I think its time to revise your plan! You cannot even live without us BUT we can live without you!"

Thai,"Love for life ( I want to write article which is nice phrase, hope you guys can help me. Thanks ) I am a women who will hits 30 just right behind me. I been heard and throught about love from my experiences for my whole life. Sometimes good... sometimes bad. It depends on what you think about it but everytimes we must learn from it day by day. Time could help you to heal when you get pain from love and also could bring love to you in a moment. People always scared to get into love because they don't know that love will be last very long or just a moment to end up with pain but I never be afraid to take that risk. Love is too beautiful to be scared of. We only have one life, why have to make it that difficult. For me, if one day I have to die, I will die but my love still with someone that I loved. Positive love always makes you're happy no matter what people did to you. Stay happy and appreciate for what you have. It's the best way for life. Life is too short to be unhappy. Take it or leave it. You know the answer. :)"

There were a lot of people but we had this privilege card so we could buy our tickets at the new machine, no need to line up. The movie was quite good though most characters died pretty easily. My favorite one was Gambit. Hope he has more screen time in the next X-Men movie. (I'm sure there will be one.) After the movie, we went to a river-sided restaurant, which was something we rarely do since it gave us the feeling of ""family restaurant.""

Thai,"A problem of Thailand. Thailandâ€™s problems in term of Thai people we have different point of view. Nowadays most Thais are more concerning about politics economics educations social religion but how many of them focus on pollution of the environment? I believe this problem not only affect Thais but also other people around the world in long term. My experience aboard provide a wider perspective on this problem. In many parts of the world, people are becoming more worried about the danger of pollution and its effect on the environment . For instance Korean are trending bring their own shopping bags when go to supermarket otherwise they have to pay for it. Japanese offers discount to a customer who not use a plastic bag. Australian usually ask â€œDo you need a bag?â€ in order to save the amount of consuming plastic bags, Whereas Thais who bring their own shopping bags are very rare to find. Moreover, the cashier also gives too many plastic bags. As we known, plastic is produced by chemical processes and can be formed into shapes when heated. There are many different types of plastic some of them are not biodegradable, unable to decay naturally, the amount of harmful chemicals are releasing into the atmosphere and their effect the environment. I think Thai people should take a serious action on this matter."

But those were not enough to change my attitude towards the true meaning of â€œbirthdayâ€. Itâ€™s still just a normal day for me. Just another day that happened to exist only once a year. However, I always think that â€œbirthdayâ€ is a very special day of one person. The person who most people would never think of when it comes to their birthday. Their motherâ€¦â€¦. â€œYour birthday is the day your mother suffered one of the greatest pain in her life.â€ This quote was my fatherâ€™s and I always remembered it since I was a kid. So, every year, after the party, I never forgot to wish for my mom and hugged her with all the good feeling I had. And this year alsoâ€¦â€¦.. Yesterday, after I finished my work, I hurried back home without slacking off. On the way home, I bought a cute tiny cake which was topped with cream in heart shaped and carefully carried it all the way home. I bought it from a bakery shop on the train station which means I need to carefully hold it while fighting with the crowds to barge my way in the train. (Believe me, in Thailand itâ€™s also like that ^ ^) I felt like if I were to died on the train, it didnâ€™t really matter as long as this cake was safely delivered to my mom with a postcard that said â€œI love you, momâ€ (à¸œà¸¡à¸£à¸±à¸à¸„à¸¸à¸“à¹à¸¡à¹ˆà¸„à¸£à¸±à¸š) Yesterday I received a lot of wishes from my friends and I even got a birthday present from my co-workers. I was very happy about these even so thereâ€™s no more party like my old days anymore. But the happiest moment I had yesterday was not on when I received sincerely wishes from my friends or that cute little pink colored teddy bear from my co-workers. It was the smile of the dearest woman in my life, my mom, that made me felt like my life is still worthyâ€¦."

It was a lovely movie, the story told about teenager love, how it happened and recognized the good memory for thirty years ago. Thai People liked this movie and let all actors and actresses be the superstar in one week. Most popular movies are all about love and it became famous from the movie director's point of view. Everytime when people go to the theater, we can let our memory flash back to our mind, it can fresh up your mind, when you feel tried, please try this movie. http://th.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%9F%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%89%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99"

I was surprise because it was crowded of motorbikes on the street, It's very interesting! On the way people are selling stuffs, like helmets, cigarettes, drinks, foods or even mosguito net. They just put the product on the floor and sell it. Woww... it's rather easy way for selling there, Well, actually we have selling stuffs on the floor in Thailand too but mosguito nets and helmets, I have never seen it in Thailand yet!! The food was also excellent! The weather is pretty unusal, it's hot in the day time but it's very cool in the night time but I liked it though. I went for the massage on the last day. It's called Stone massage, it's quite good except the stone was kind of too hot for me but it was good to try anyway. The problem for this trip is, the people couldn't speak english so it was hard for me to communicate with them but finally, I had a very good time there so I might visit there again one day or even soon."
Thai,"Time is thing that we can't bring it back to use again. Time is not a Coca-Cola can that we can recycle. When time passed, all we can do only just recall. Like ex-girlfriend's phone number that disappeared, like the first toy that broke long time ago. We can just recall, but can't grasp them out from our reminiscences. I wonder why we feel slightly sad when we think of past, we feel sad because we know. Know that those past are current that can't flow back. Take a look, in front of you, even now current of time still haven't flowed, so diligent. This two paragraphs, I chose from a lot of my books.

Thai,"Adult sport competition You may wonder what I mean by writing â€˜adult sport competitionâ€™. Is it a sport created only for adults? No, thereâ€™s nothing relevant to sport at all. Itâ€™s what Thai children today call the discord which recently (too often) happened. Thai people separated themselves into colors â€˜yellow shirtâ€™, â€˜red shirtâ€™ and blue shirt. The yellow shirt that supported the present government and had shut down Suwannabhum airport to get what they wanted which was the resignation of the previous prime minister â€˜Samakâ€™ who they think was a Taksinâ€™s puppet. The red shirt people who supported the previous Prime Minister Taksin claim that the present government is corrupt. And the blue shirt people who was against the red shirt. What the hell is all this? I understand that they did what they think was right but why canâ€™t they realize that thereâ€™s on end for this discord if on one stop. When yellow shirt people got what they wanted, the red shirt would not accept it and then again created a mob to protest it. And if the red shirt people got what they wanted, the yellow would not just sit there and do nothing (I used the word â€˜ifâ€™ because the red shirt didnâ€™t succeed) Right now, everything seems to be normal but I really donâ€™t know that how long it will be like this. Lots of people asked me what color I am. Red or Yellow or blue. My answer was Iâ€™m not in any side. My blood is red. My skin is yellow. And oh, I really love blue sky."

Each year Thailand has many celebrations and the new year party all over Thailand.

Spanish,"In reply to my friend's blog I was in a carpeted room playing ""Guess Who?"" with John McCain when a messenger on horseback brought me the news of your return. Overcome with emotion, I shed a single tear on a silver tray. Throughout your absence, I've been immensely bored and I haven't had anything to do. I once more began again my Sunday strolls with Mr. Utterson, painted some Faberge eggs; cut labels for the canned sweets, and re-read my ""Where's Wally?"" books - although it lacked the same excitement the second time after Iâ€™d highlighted Wally with a fuchsia crayonâ€¦ Now that the litany of my days has been broken, my eyes light up knowing that youâ€™ll restart the chores in the house. Perhaps what is missing are sanded, painted walls, repaired damp patches and a replacement for the cracked glass in the central skylight - but this station in any way is a desolate wasteland! Or perhaps you know of a more creative, original place than this in the world? There are those who declare there was a similar one in Persia, but they lie. I love this place; it is - was, and always will be - my favourite site on the net. Please continue to keep us updated with your work, and remember I will always love you and support you. Although to do that, I'd have to dodge the bullets of my detractors. The train scene was difficult; I know MacGyver would have done it better. Peace to everyone."
Spanish,"The Rain It rained a great deal yesterday in the night. It is neat when you fall asleep with the music of the raindrops in your ears. When I was young I used to live in a farm and loved when it was raining cats and dogs. I used to sing a song with my sister. It was something like, â€œQue llueve, que llueve, la virgen de la cueva, los pajaritos cantanâ€¦â€ I wonder if there is a childrenâ€™s song for the rain in English. I woke up this morning and it was still raining. I like the smell of this morning. It is a damp odor. When it rains very hard, the day has a smooth sadness within, and I enjoy it. I talk about the poetic side of the rain, but of course I am aware that the rain is not always poetic. I mean, many people suffer because of the rain. I am talking about farmers whom crops are ruined because of the rain. But at the same time, I think that their crops can grow (/are possible) because of the rain. Also many people lost their homes because of the flooding caused by the rain. I guess that everything in this world has to be balanced. Neither too many nor very few is good."

It has always been for me an understandable thing whether I talk or write in an acceptable way. I just want to learn English in a natural way because what I've noticed about my English is that I tend to exaggerate everything I say and as a consequence I sound fake it seems... That's why I'm travelling to the States this year... when Dec arrives. I think It'll be the 13th like at 7 o' clock.

So, as you may have noticed this is going to be quite an adventure for me. I am gonna miss a lot of people and think Ill be missed for some.

Last week, I did two English exams. In the first one, we had to write a summary of a given text. In the second one, we had to answer a reading comprehension and we also had to write a composition. When I finished the second exam, I realized something: not only havenâ€™t I learnt anything this year, but Iâ€™m also losing my capacity of expression. Iâ€™m really disappointed with my career. I have six subjects, but I only learn something in two of them. Whatâ€™s more, my English and my Spanish are worse than before. Iâ€™m planning to read a lot and to watch films in English. Iâ€™d prefer to go to Ireland or Great Britain, though. If I go there, I think my English would improve. The problem is that I have to get my driving license and I have to go to my village.

Spanish,"a nice long week This week was filled with a lot of things. First, last Wednesday I did an exam at the university. But the context was the one of a movie. All that day was raining. I went to the workplace (office) with the company of a soft water falling from a silver cloud. At lunch, a thin rain induced me to buy a delicious dish (empanadas). When I was going to the university, it was raining really hard, and I got a headache. I solve the exam really fast, and then I went home, to slept. The last Thursday I had to inscribe me to the courses of this semester. I choose some subjects, that will allow me to keep working while studding. my career, engineering, really takes time to be completed, and it is really easy to lost years if you do not pass one subject in time. Some times, because of being at work, you could not assit and looses exams, just a little problem, with a big impact on your life. I started this week to study, I feel condifent I will have a nice semester. A good news is that a coworker lend me a book about kanji... all written in japanese. It will take time to digest it, but it will be so sweet to read it that I am really happy about that. Nowadays my current topic at Japanese is to end learning katakana, that is why I have to wait until I could learn more vocabulary, verbs in particular."
Spanish,"Just an entry Hi, everyone! :D! I hadn't written here in a while. Now, I'm on vacations. I haven't done anything extraordinary since I was sick until few days ago. What I did -and was really nice-, was going to a rock concert from a local band. They turned out to be awesome. I had listened to their previous records, and knew some of their songs by heart, but being there was just unexpectedly great. They're called ""Caramelos de cianuro"" (Cyanide candies) and here: http://www.caramelosdecianuro.net/ you can listen to some of their recent tracks, really nice, in my opinion. Hope everyone is having fun on summer! -Indramon"

Spanish,"My Health Problems (second part) I'm aware of my health problems and I admit to having bad habits,so I am going to try to exercise more often because I have a lot of time on my hands. I have to come up with a clever plan to change these habits. Last year, I used to go swimming, do athletics or play tennis. My friends made fun of me because I always got hurt (It was either my leg or my arm and so on and so forth). But this year, I became a real couch potato. I'm considering going on a diet and buying new equipment like a new indoor bicycle and all that sort of stuff. Without taking notice of the things I already have, I'll buy new things to motivate me. I wish it was easy to begin practicing a new sport. It always hurts your muscles and it's very daunting and tough at first. Tomorrow morning I'll get up early and go out to run. Aside from that, I'll lift weights in the afternoon. I was told that drinking lot of water is very important because if you lose one percent of water during the exercise, your performance decreases 10 percent, so I need to drink water before, during and after exercising. I found a marvelous website , www. bodyrock. tv (from then on I became a bodyrocker as she says), where you can learn tips and find fitness advice or workout videos. I've learned a lot from Zuzana. She knows a lot: I tip my hat to her. You should check out her videos on Youtube because they're strikingly good. Every time I watch her videos I learn something. I really appreciate her exhaustive efforts to make us more healthy. My goal is to raise the bar each day (with this I mean I'll improve every day, make sense?), and at the end of 2011 I'll be able to do the same workouts that I did in 2009. As I get used to the workouts I have to eat only low-calorie food like fish. Of course lots of water, and no soft drinks or alcohol. Which is quite easy because I never liked them to begin with."

Spanish,ummhh I have to write a long journal for my class and I do not know anyone to proofread my paper.
Spanish,"teacher or book I think that to learn with a help from a teacher is better than to learn yourself. I remember when I was a child, my teacher, my friends and I were reading a book and we didnâ€™t understand the meaning of both in the sentence â€˜Scarcely had the lion and the tigers arrived in the lake when both animals died of thirstâ€™. Miss Carolina, what is the meaning of both? Said my friends and me. My teacher said to us that both are referring to the tigers and the lions together. It is funnier that a person talks you about something and you listen to her/him than to read a book with a small writing without pictures."

Spanish,"Watch for Watchmen! Today I went to see the movie Watchmen. I liked it very much. For serveral years, some friends of mine, whom are very well versed on comic books, suggest me to read Watchmen. Now Im sorry i did not follow their advise. If the comic is half as good as the movie I should have read it long before. The deep, and humanity of the characters is unlikely of the stereotipical comic book heroes. The history treats several interesting themes as, human nature, perceived reality, politics and the line betwen ideologis and the real world. The movie is set in an alternate reality in 1985, where vigilantes like Batman are real and once, even sponsored by the goverment, but then outlawed by Nixon who in his third period on the oval office.(WTF!) The world is a brink of nuclear war, and a famous vigilante, the Comedian was killed, setting a great and coplex history in movement. My favorite character is Rorschach, a detective like vigilante whose mask changes on black and white ink dots patterns. He is very skillful and cunning, also a badass who delivers justice to criminals with great violence. I took my mother to see this movie with me. She says she enjoy it, but I think it was a little hard to understant for her."

Spanish,"Back to the University Classes have resumed today at my university, which stayed closed for about a month. Many things have changed. Now there are security cameras everywhere, and the access to enter the university is more limited. Many people who sold candies or coffee wonâ€™t be able to do it any longer, because that is not allowed now. The university resembles a jail, with all those restrictions, the cameras, and those boys in blue at the entrance. I am aware that there were many problems and riots inside the university, but I donâ€™t know, I donâ€™t think that things are better right now."
Spanish,"Verbs ""to get"" and ""to have"" I found a lot of problems when I am trying to use and translate this two verbs.

The same I think about ""to have"", even I found the word ""get"" in a place I thought the word ""have"" was more appropiate. Anyone can help me?"

I would have loved to show her the west coast of the country, but 4 days was not enough for that, so we just stayed in Dublin. On the third day, we bought a day ticket for the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transport), and we travelled to the surrounding villages outside of Dublin. In the morning we went to the south and we stopped in Killeney and Seapoint. In the afternoon we went to the north and stopped in Raheny and Sulton. All Dublin pictures, except 4 or 5 that I shot in march when I arrived to Ireland before going to Galway, were taken in september 2009."
Spanish,"Please, Can somebody correct it? The problems for choose the type of goverment in America started later of the Revolutionary War; when instead of a colony; America was a new young country. There were opinions trying to decide if a Strong federal goverment would be better or a weak central goverment. However, there was a lot of war veterans who preferred a strong central goverment; in that way can became a powerful political force and have back pay from goverment for their efforts on war. Also, some soldiers wanted a strong federal goverment because they believed than they could save their money to theirselves."

Spanish,"Code-mixing I know several people dislikes the use of code swithching. In my personal opinion there is always a place and time to use it. In my community code-mixing(Spanglish) is a very common practice. I use it very often with my friends and family, but I never use it for academic or professional purposes. I think is cool to have a different way to communicate. I never used Spanglish in Mexico. I know is not as important as Standard English, but I learned to use because I wanted to be able to understand my classmates and friends, basically because I wanted to feel a sense of belonging. Anyways, my main goal is to learn Standard English, but I would also like to be able to understand different dialects. What do you think?"

Now, I'm in a place with a maximum of 8ÂºC or below. The good thing about it is that I like cold weather and Winter (also in Summer)"
Spanish,"China's pollution Today, I saw a documentary about China's pollution. In my opinion, there is a lot of pollution over there because the handwork is too cheaper. Most of the companies from overseas put their factory over there. I have an Iphone which it says that is designed in United States and assembled in China. This is obviously that in China the handwork is very cheaper than United States. Also, There are a lot of Chinese people. The country is over polluted. What I have learned in History is that Chinese people were always dominated by another region so their culture is different in different parts of China. The government should do something to reduce the pollution over there."

There are things I don't understand when I listen the song and some other things I don't really know if I am undertanding them right or if it's just my brain. So, I've tried to write down the parts that I do understand and, if you could help me a little bit with some verses or even just a sentence or a word I would appreciate it very much <3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiX4WZb7utg I figure that you're OK living your life the way that you thought that it should be easier and free you thought that it should be. From the bus to the train sleeping out in the rain you don't need anything at all, anything at all, anything at all. You left the city and said that you liked how we held each other highly in regard gently in our arms highly in regard When I came out to you Â¿-? Did we want anything at all, anything at all, anything at all? Anything at all, you said: â€œPlease, don't write those love songs just for me. Life's gonna fly right before our eyes So now is the time for living free.â€ Now I've tried to forget all the straps on your dress how they wrapped around you tightly wrapped around you tightly wrapped around you tighter than my arms ever could when we danced on the hardwood you whispered in my ear, whispered all your fears and I told you: â€œdear, anything at all, that you need all you would have to say is: please. Life is gonna fly right before our eyes so, now is the time that we can be.â€ An unexpected moment I still laugh, when I recall that crooked smile you turned when we danced. So, you keep your heart I would just need a part of it. anything at all, anything at all, anything at all. You could call late at night if you needed something right away anything at all, anything at all. anything at all, I just need to hear you whisper: please. Life's gonna fly right before our eyes So, right now can we be? Can we be anything all? 'Cuz I just need to hear you whisper: please, life's gonna fly right before our eyes so, right now can we be? Thank you very much!"

Spanish,"From the TV perspective Two and a half men is a very popular tv show, my parents watch it like... almost everyday haha, they have been watching the show for about a year or so, I never knew it was such a global phenomenon until now that the big news that the showÂ´s been canceled is all over the place, heck I just watched a movie called Due Date (or something) and that show is featured in it. I like Two and a half men, sometimes I watch it and it does make me laugh, but like most american shows IÂ´ve enjoyed, I donÂ´t ever really get hooked to them, not like japanese anime shows, which are more like mexican soap operas+kung fu with one big story arch that encompases ten or twenty episodes, I wonder which formula is actually more evil hahaha, IÂ´ve been watching anime since I was like 4, and I would always get so hooked to their stories and characters. Now, I used to be a hardcore gamer (now IÂ´m casual... thatÂ´s what they all say I know), and I also wonder why the Japanese never do First Person Shooter videogames or even RTS (real time strategy) games, and why Americans rarely do RPG games, well actually they make them more frequently now but itÂ´s usually in the form of a First Person Shooter/RTS game! haha. Anyways thereÂ´s a point to this haha, pretty much, I notice that the japanese tend to have more solid ideals or methods that reject change while americans tend to be more flexible with their philosophies, I mean thatÂ´s kind of what IÂ´ve been noticing, and at least those differences show a lot in their pop culture. Of course the USA is a melting pot of cultures while Japan is pretty much unicultural. In Mexico, I think people from the south are a little bit more like the Japanese, more formal, more traditional, they probably even have a more powerful sense of pride in being Mexican(or whatever they are/do), while in the North we are more informal, we speak kinda rude sometimes, yell a lot more, we speak our mind more, we expect others to speak their minds, we rarely wear suits in our jobs, haha etc. Of course when you travel you learn things might not be as stereotipical but I assume that as time goes by, and the world becomes a more global society, new, maybe more organic forms of behavior will develope. I might not know much about the world yet but, IÂ´m pretty sure thats already happening."

Spanish,"To take a walk is healthy! (>__<)=d Over now, I will walk more. For two reasons. The first one is because it's good for the health! The second reason is because my new school is on sixteen blocks from my house. It's the nearest school. And the supermaket is about 10 blocks over here. So I will walk because I have to walk. I didn't walk since one year. I always went out to take a walk because I lived near from a park. The botanical park was in front of my house. But now I live in another city and the park is near from my house. It is ten blocks from here. (over here?) . I was searching on Internet and I found the benefits of take a walk. They are many. * It helps to control the weight. * Improvement the blood circulation. * Avoids the cardiacs problems. * Helps to the digestion. * Acts like a hungry suppressor * Maintains the bones healthy and strong, helping to straighten them. * Eliminates tensions and concerns. * Prevent breathing problems. * Deletes the fat. * Tonify the thighs, calf and hip muscles. * Improvement the peripheral vision. * Increases the level of endorphins. The endorphins are the natural soothing produced by the body. * Promotes the system immunity. * Helps to grow up. Well, with those benefits of course I will walk more. I want to grow up!!

The ""jamÃ³n serrano"" is the leg of the pig. They must be cured with salt , the temperatue and humidity is important too. The salt will go inside , and they only have to take the just enough and at the same time the water will go away from the meat. The way you cut it ,is important too. And itÂ´s the best if you cut it just when you want to eat it. Nobody can resist to a good plate of ""jamÃ³n serrano""!! Do you want to try it?"

Spanish,"World Cup By these days, people only talks about football. Well, I am not the exception to that rule. For that reason, I want to talk a little about the World Cup. I think Argentina will win the cup. As Maradona said: â€œWe have Messiâ€. In this moment Messi is the best football player in the world. He is very fast; and when he is running, it looks like the ball was attached to his foot. Some people say that Ronaldo or Rooney are the best, but they are already out of the competition. However I am worried about Argentina next match. Germany team showed a good game against England team. Argentina vs Germany is the best game in the next stage of the World Cup. Despite this, I am sure Argentina will obtain its third cup."
Spanish,"Translation: Charles Darwin Charles Darwin was an English naturalist who postulated that all living species have evolved over time from a common antecessor through a process called natural selection. Born in Shrewsbury, on February 12th 1809, Darwin was the fifth son of a well-off English family. After studying medicine in Edinburgh for two years, he entered Cambridge to study theology. One of his professors, the botanist Dr. Henslow, made him regain his interest in natural sciences, and especially in geology, botany and entomology. With his recommendation, he embarked on the Beagle as the naturalist of the expedition of Captain Fitzroy in 1831. For five years they traveled across South America and the Pacific islands and the young Darwin was gathering observations upon which he would base all his later investigations. In 1871 he published the book â€œThe descent of manâ€, where he defended the theory that the evolution of men started from an animal similar to the monkey. Religious authorities called him atheist and blasphemous. ******* Charles Darwin fue un naturalista inglÃ©s que postulÃ³ que todas las especies de seres vivos han evolucionado con el tiempo a partir de un antepasado comÃºn mediante un proceso denominado selecciÃ³n natural.

Spanish,"My hometown I believe that my hometown, Puerto de Sagunto, is a boring place if you are a teenager and you live there in winter. But despite of this, it is the best place to stay in summer. Puerto de Sagunto is a seaside town where people have a good time doing many things. For example, dancing, swimming, doing sports, going to concertsâ€¦ As for nightlife, I think that there are not too many places to go, only two or three discos. It seems to me that it happens because people prefer to drink near the beach paying a cheaper alcohol. Furthermore, in winter it is quite cold so you canâ€™t go to swim. To sum up, itâ€™s a beautiful place or a boring place, depending on the issue."
Spanish,"One question!! When you write something talking about you, for example: I go to beach next summer, and I will go to eat a paella. Always say ""I"" my question is: when you write ""I"" always must be like this ""I"" and no like this ""i""?? I hope you understand me!!"
Spanish,"Waiting for you Waiting him is what she hates the most. 10.35 pm Heâ€™s not at home yet. A soft whimper breaks the silence. She looks again the old clock. 11.05 pm â€œWhere are you?â€ 11.30 pm The silence is surrounding her and she can help trembling while thinks about him. The living-room is cold, so is she. 11.55 pm â€œWhere are you?â€ Her voice is a whisper that disappears into the living-room like a dream does when the night is over. â€œIâ€™m waiting for youâ€¦ where are you?â€ 12.15 am She can stand it anymore and turn on the tv and her eyes got fixed on the screen. Breaking news: A young man dies in a horrible car accident. The culprit was driving under the influence of drugs and he hit the young man that was waiting for the last busâ€¦. The sound of keys makes her jump and run though the corridor. She needs to reach the main door, she needs to know that heâ€™s fineâ€¦ alive. Breathless, she finally arrives there to find him putting his shoes off and sheâ€™s unable to control herself and holds him so tight that he can breathe. $â€œHey, whatâ€™s wrong, babe?â€ the boy asks softy, heâ€™s tired because of work. â€œNothing, youâ€™re here, thatâ€™s the only thing I need right nowâ€ Smiling, the boy kisses her head and pulls her away softy â€œItâ€™s late, you should be sleeping, no waiting for meâ€ he says tenderly â€œYou know I wonâ€™t be sleeping until youâ€™ll be hereâ€ Narrowing his eyes, the boy walks through the corridor until he realizes the TV is still on. â€œGo to our room, Iâ€™ll turn off the TV and the lightsâ€ In silence, he crosses the door and his eyes glues on the screen. A manâ€™s bloody body lies on the road and next to him; a young woman cries her lungs out while two policemen try to avoid her to look at the cadaver. Feeling goosebumps he turns off the TV and goes to their room. There, he holds her tight making her smile. â€œNow youâ€™re here I can sleepâ€ For the first time in five years, he understands why sheâ€™s always waiting for him to come back home."

Spanish,"Addition When I am on my way to the university in the bus, I like to talk up about any issue in English. This is just for keeping my practice. Today I tried to talk about math, but I realized that I didnâ€™t now how to talk properly about math in English. For that reason, when I came home, I decided to look for some math lessons for kids on the Internet. When you are learning a language you are like a kid in all the way, I mean you must learn again everything you have learned until now in a different language. So, I dived right in math. I studied some beginning addition lessons using sets in order to explain how it works. A neat way to teach kids how addition works is like this: get a yardstick and something to mark it, it could be a rock or a minute stick. For doing, for example, 5+6, place the mark at the position of the yardstick with the number 5, and then move up 6 places (since it is plus 6). Your final position should be at 11. So, 5+6=11. Isnâ€™t easy?"

Spanish,"Three Spanish speaking movies HI. This text is a little long, so you don't have to read it all or correct it all. If you want to correct one or two lines, it would be great. Thanks in advance. Today I saw two different films. One in the movies, and the other in my computer. I usually do not like going to the movies, because I consider it very expensive and I cannot do anything else in the movies, but to watch the film, so I have the feeling I am losing precious time. While in my house, it is free, and I can do homework, study English and Korean, reply emails, etc. Those are the main reasons why I do not go that often to the theatre. However today my mother paid the tickets, and I end up going to Cinepolis. There were different interesting and commercial pictures, which I can easily download anytime. So I chose a movie that was not that common, so my going to the movies would be worth it. I picked ""La casa muda"" (Silent House). I do not regret my election, despite the fact of being crappy from almost any angle, because it was something different. It was filmed in Uruguay and is based on real events. The movie was filmed using just one camera and in real time, that is quite an achievement. Although the story and the results of the one-camera-real-time experiment were not that good. In other words, I would say this movie sucked not hard, but sucked anyway. However, I read in some forums that people were claiming Uruguayan film industry was improving because of this picture. Given its low quality and insignificant funding, I find this fact as astonishing. The plot, if you can call it that way, was about a girl, his father and the owner of a country house. The former two go to the house to repair it, so the it can be rented or sold, I do not know. There are some interesting things revealed at the end and the abnormal events happening in the house (well, the abnormal event that happen in that night). Second movie. I remember a few months ago, following the explained logic, I picked ""El Camino de las Flores"" (The Road of Flowers). This was a Mexican product which took place in the Northern state of Baja California (however the actors talked with an obvious Mexico-city accent). The main idea was OK, but there were so many incoherences. This was a normal movie in terms of the filming (many cameras, good sound, different angles, etc.), and I remember there was a strong marketing campaign for this movie, I naively thought ""if Mexicans don't do horror movies that often, at least the few ones that come out must be good, see the campaign! It must be good"" I was wrong. This movie totally sucked, and I felt pretty bad because I was expecting something better given the enthusiastically made mock-ups in Cinepolis. It was very predictable, the ending was completely off, and there were many unexplained things. I wish I could say something better about this movie, but I cannot. Third movie. After coming back from the theatre, I searched information about Silent House, and I ran into ""Los Ojos de Julia"" (Julia's eyes) in a forum. A Spanish movie from the directors of the Orfanato (Foster House?), I decided to watch it. This was a very good movie. I am not saying OMG this THE movie, but it was pretty good, specially when compared to the other two. The story was fine, maybe a little predictable in the last quarter of the movie, the acting was amazing and the overall quality of the movie (don't know the word, maybe the image or fotography) was on pair with US American movies. After watching these three films, all Spanish speaking ones, I wondered why countries which do not produce horror movies that often, or which do not have a big film industry (Mexico and Uruguay) come up with these sucky movies. In the case of Uruguay, I guessed the director did not have much funds, but if you are going to film something so bad, better not to film anything. In the case of Mexico, this was not the first recent horror movie, KM31 was not amazing, but was way better than El Camino de las Flores. So if the film industry does not have much funding or official support, why are they still making pretty bad movies? It is supposed to be the contrary, when there are not so many opportunities around, you are supposed to be the best and do the best so you can guarantee future funding. Maybe the special effects will not be that great, and the acting, not the best given the financial restrictions, but the story can and must be good and interesting. Mexico is full of superstitious people and crazy legends, you can get good stories if you look for them. The Spaniards have been doing great (or OK) horror or suspense movies: Thesis, REC, Foster House/el Orfanato, Backbone's Devil/El Espinazo del Diablo, which is also a coproduction with Mexico, and now Julia's Eyes. Like the director of The Foster House, if you make interesting and good movies, then you will get more funds for the next one. I praise that Mexicans (I cannot talk about Uruguay since Silent House should not be even considered a professional movie) are making incursions in different genres, instead of sticking to the boring and predictable romance movie, but if you are going to use scarce resources, then do something good!"

Spanish,"[ING 003] On time and Technologie On time and Technologie It has been very evident for all us that new inventions have brought us a lot of advantages. Among the wide range of items that make part of this century and that are considered to be part of the human mindâ€™s most incredible creations, it is possible to find trains, computers (in all their ways: Ipods, Pcs, mp3 players, etc ) and a thousand other things. All those elements are the result of centuries of work in which human being has tried to fight against the things that have made his life more difficult. As an example, trains were created in order to eliminate space and time obstacles between people. Letâ€™s imagine for a moment the classic scene of the two lovers who have to separate from each other having to wait a long time not only to see each other again but also for receiving news from his/her beloved. Traditional communication ways as mail post took (and still take) too much time to bring a message that sometimes can save lifes. Horses have been replaced by planes as well as ships. All those are inventions with the power to send a flower from Australia to Finland or a Cd from South Africa to Canada. More than the 50% of the population now is able to dream of traveling to a foreign land far away from his original continent. This dream is also nourished by the thousand of images and videos watched everyday from every coin of the world. Despite of the fact that I can spend even days talking about the advantages of nowadays technologie, today I want to talk about the negative part that still exists when using it. Fifteen years ago I hardly know that the best computer application was DOS. Today my room is â€œdecoratedâ€ with a printer and a laptop that is connected to a home theater in which I can listen to a Hi quality disc. Ten years ago I knew that somewhere on the net I would find the answer to most of the questions I had just by introducing the letters www. google. com and spending about ten minutes searching for the answer. Eventhough human being adapts to everything, in this case adaptation has turned to be an exagerated search of take advantage of time. Nowadays, we get extremely stressed when google takes more than 5 seconds to show a result and we get even more stressed if we have to retype the words again because we didnâ€™t write it properly. We feel worry if a message we are waiting for doesnâ€™t arrive immediately and we start to reload and reload hundreds of times our mail inbox page. The worst thing has arrived with facebook, where thousands of people are sticked to the screen during hours just to wait that someone â€œlikesâ€ his last (from the thousands a day) comment. I have tried to show that internet has changed our lifes in a positive as well as in a negative way. In the other hand, does everybody try to use internet to take advantage of time or rather to use the rest of the time on it? Social networks have become social networks instead of being virtual social networks! Teenagers read (useful things) less than before and spent more time in front of the screen instead of feeling how a walk can make them feel better. I realized that I become addicted to Lang-8. But it is only an addiction that tries to calm down my anxiety for learning languages. In addition, I also discovered that my time conception depends on my stressing environment. It is up to me to change this. And there is a lot to talk about concerning this topic. Life has given me a warning that I want to follow. I am thinking about a new way of leaning which I will tell in my newer posts. Thanks for reading, correcting and commenting. What is your conception of time??"
Spanish,"The bulletin board Daily, The bulletin board is full of papers in which the people write some ads, one or two are so dumb.

Turn it in at the office. No questions will be asked. I really need it"" Or like it: ""If you found my wallet, please return it. You can take all my money, only I need my school identification"" Or worse: ""I ask reward for return my cell phone. It's urgent. I'm Roberto, group 505."" What does it mean? Does it mean that Roberto wants money and his cell phone? He's crazy. But not all ads are stupids. There are many informative ads pasted by the administration."

Spanish,"letter of motivation Dear Sir or Madam, My name is Patricia M. Vera S., I am 26 years old, Venezuelan citizen and I obtained my degree from the Universidad Central de Venezuela in 2007 as a Chemical Engineer. I speak and write English and I am currently studying French. Through your Web site and other specialized publications, I was been able to obtain valuable information about the Specialized Master in Gas Engineering and Management you offer in your vast portfolio of graduate courses and mastersâ€™ degrees. I'm really interested for the mentioned program, because I want to extend my academic credentials in the area of gas, area in which I did various projects during my studies in chemical engineering. I would like to start The Masterâ€™s Degree in Gas Engineering and Management the next academic period that starts in September-2010. Worldwide one of the sectors that is booming is the transportation, storage, distribution and use of gaseous fuels. For that reasons I think this would give me a strong background as a chemical engineer in this area, as well as forming the technological development by applying in the industry knowledge efficiently and successfully, and taking leadership positions in major sectors of engineering. What makes this special to me are the 2-stage Master which includes the acquisition of skills learned through courses taught by gas industry experts and situation scenarios and the second one is putting those skills into practice and developing them through a 4-month internship abroad. In the other hand, the offer of GDF SUEZ for recruiting a young engineers and offer to finance â‚¬14,000, including their Masterâ€™s Degree year and the payment an allowance for their internship period in one of the Groupâ€™s foreign subsidiaries, to defray educational costs and at the end of the program, the young graduates join GDF SUEZ for a minimum of 4 years, starting in a technical management or team management job within the Research and Innovation Department, or a subsidiary of the Infrastructures Division. I believe that I have the right profile to be accepted by the GDF SUEZ and initiate studies with them in September of this year, I am willing to travel wherever you need at anytime. I enclose herewith my resume and I remain at your disposal to provide more information, thanking the attention given to this letter, Yours sincerely"
Spanish,"Brief introduction in English Hello everyone! If you are reading this I'm more than thankful for that. I haven't really been studying English but as I'm living in a English speaking country I came to learn it naturally. Of course I'm not saying I'm a native speaker, I'm far far away from that. I'm afraid my mother tongue which is Spanish influences my English a lot. I've found myself several times trying to say something the way I'd do it in Spanish, and as those languages are quite similar each other sometimes I trust too much in that deed trying to say a word I don't know in English using my Spanish vocab with a weird accent because maybe the word is similar in both languages, which sometimes works but most of the times it doesn't. Anyway, I believe that this site will help to train my brain to think the way a native English speaker would think. I've found myself really enjoying learning new languages because I believe languages are not only words or grammatical structures but a way to deliver your mind to people you wouldn't even imagine, and I came to realised that languages contain the culture and I'd go farther and say the heart, the passion and manners of the people. I'd like to encourage the people out there to learn a second and why not a third tongue as it is a great experience."
Spanish,"A controversial topic The gay marriage Nowadays, People have the right to get married, it is a right for everyone but what do you think about the gay marriage? Firstly, some people same that everyone have the right to be happy and the law is the same for all. For that reason, there should not matter the sexual orientation. Besides, many experts believe that children raised by homosexual couples grow as well as children raised by heterosexual couples. However, religious people think that God only created man and woman to form a family. Also, many people say that the adoptation only be allowed to heterosexual couples because children could be confused in a gay marriage.

LEARNING A LANGUAGE Learning a language is like doing a jigsaw puzzle of a million pieces with a picture that keeps changing. It's like getting lost in a foreign city without a map. It's like playing tennis without a ball, like being an ant in a field of grasshoppers. It's being an acrobat with a broken leg, an actor without a script, a carpenter without a saw, a storyteller without a middle or an end. But then gradually itÂ¹s like being out in the early morning with the mists lifting. ItÂ¹s like a chink of light under a door, like finding the glove you were looking for, catching the train you thought you were going to miss, getting an unlooked-for present, exchanging a smile. And then one day it's like riding a bicycle very fast downhill. Olivia McMahon"

Spanish,"Chosen After too many hour of sleep deprivation I was exhausted. I was feeling like a corpse that didn't notice its death and kept breathing. The wall was gray, the humidity was excesive. I was losing the sense of the time. And I started to hallucinate. Then, my captors opened the door, gave a slice of bread and some water. They told me: 'Get up and come with us' I did that. I was noticing some king of presence in my back, was it a ghost? it was saying me: 'You are the one, we have chosen you for the mission'. My captors bandaged my eyes, I couldn't see anything. They kept me walking for some time, I think I walked through a forest. It was cold. I was almost nude. At some moment I felt like I was walking alone... and I was. I reached a solid soil, clearly I reached a road. I couldn't get rid of the bandage over my eyes, My hands were handcuffed in my back. I hear a noise coming. It was a vehicle. It got closer to me too quickly and knocked me down. *To continue* All rights reserved (c) 2010 Mick Murillo"

Spanish,"An Autobiography I was born in the early 80's, in an industrial city in the province of Ciudad Real, Spain. I don't have many memories about when i went into the kinder garden, only that I went there 2 years Then I went to the primary school where i made some friends, specially where I met my best friend, in that time we really hate each other, we don't be close until the secondary school. Fortunately or unfortunately.. when we finished the primary school and move to the higschool, the goverment decided to change the Educational System, the level in the classes was so high and i had many problems with my marks. I must recognize in that time i was really bad student. Since i was child i showed much more skills in artistic activities, specially drawing and painting. I decided studied Fine Arts. I moved to another city for study. I lived in Cuenca for 7 years, the best years of my life i guess.. Some summers when i went back to my hometown since I was 18 year old I worked in a part time job to financing my studies. Two years ago I finished my Fine Arts degree, then i did a Master for teachers. I'm kinda interested to teach, one of the reason that help me to become much more interested was.. the period of practises when I work as teacher, was really cool experience. Last summer I went in an academy in Ireland studying languages with an English Grant, was my first time abroad and one of the best experiences in my life. Currenly I'm keep studying English in a school of languages and i'm preparing my teacher examination in an academy. I'd like to work as teacher of art in Highchool. I hope to be a nice teacher in the future."
Spanish,"Going back to Sweden (The following is a future entry in my blog, where I explain my Erasmus experience in Sweden. I have decided to begin writing in it also in English in order to improve my writing with the corrections of the beloved community of Lang8 :)) [Note for readers] Hi there! I have decided to start writing down my blog, in which I write about my stay in Sweden, in English. The objective is to improve my English and to give you the opportunity of reading about my insignificant life! My stay in Spain due to the Christmasâ€™ break is finishing tomorrow, and Iâ€™m going back to classes in my dear adoptive city: Stockholm. During all the vacation I have been seeing in the forecast how temperatures were softer than when I was there. .. shit! Even these days it has been over 0 degrees, and it seems that my beloved snow (always pretty, though a bit son of a bitch when you are carrying your suitcase) is melting down. Anyway, for all the people who are saying that Iâ€™m going to freeze up and blah blah, I go by the facts: 15th December, Madrid = -6Âº, Stockholm = 0Âº. Ok, ok, to be fair, the truth is that here in Spain it has been a great weather all Christmas. The only days it got chiller, it was no more that what I call â€œamateur coldâ€. For Christ sake, I would send all of you that are complaining with shit like â€œThe street is coldâ€ or â€œI want to go insideâ€ to the lake near my residence in Sweden, where the poor ducks have been confined to a little spot because of the implacable ice. Anyway, being here these weeks in Christmas (oh fuck, I love to have actual holidays in Christmas) has made that I have became aware of some little things of the life I have missed about my dear homeland all these months. And, of course, some things that suck about being here. All about this in this pretty list of pros and cons: Pro: â€œCaÃ±as y tapasâ€. Because there is nothing better in life that taking a cold beer accompanied with a delicious Spanish â€œtapaâ€. Con: â€œCanisâ€ and other suburban tribes, characterized by their IQ, near to Sweden mean temperature. I prefer Swedish people that smooth back their hair with gel and wear big empty glasses. Pro: To get out and not being scare of death from exposure. In Spain is not necessary to take care of having all your skin covered, with risk of amputation caused by frostbite. Con: Spanish rubbish television: despite I rarely watch television, when the shit hits the fanâ€¦Special consideration to the New Yearâ€™s Eve program with all the pink press. FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU!! Pro: To cook far away from the smoke detector. Mhhâ€¦well, right. What I really wanted to say was: Pro: Not cook!! Con: Everybody saying: â€œBut you must have not been unnoticed there!â€ Well, ok, I know Iâ€™m blonde with blue eyes, but stop saying that all the timesâ€¦Iâ€™m purely Spanish, you fucking idiots! And, with no more to sayâ€¦au revoire Spain! See you soon!"

Spanish,"The 8 dumbest car stealers or the 8 most stupid car thiefs 8. Was he committed? Yes. Was he smart? No. Carjacking is the serious crime that consists of taking a vehicle when it is in possession of another person. According to federal law, who commits this crime can receive a sentence up to 15 years in jail if they are found guilty. We can say that Tyrone Davisâ€™ problem was not his firm character, but the lack of focus. After all, he had two long weeks robbing two stores, entering a house, assaulting a 41 year old woman that lived there and then stealing her car in December of 2006. We have not even mentioned what brought him to our list. He was trying to escape from the Titusville police and he crashed his Dodge Shadow 1992 against the curb. Then, Davis, with a knife on his hand, tried to steal a Saab that was stopped at an intersection. He could only grab the door handle before the driver stepped on the gas pedal in order to flee. However, the driver drove fast with Davis still hanging from the door handle. Next, in a display of dedication that almost deserves praise if it was not so stupid, David kept on grabbing the door handle for several blocks and at speeds up to 45 miles per hour. In fact, Davis only let the handle go when he was tackled by a police officer."

Spanish,"A joke? Yesterday, my brother reminded me about a travel to Tenerife that we did five years ago, especially several strange situations that was happened us. The first day I arrived in the island, we sat down in a bar and I ordered a milkshake because I have never liked the coffee. The waiter told me he didnâ€™t had it, so I decided to order a glass of milk. At this moment, the waiter by looking at me like I was a mad man said he didnâ€™t understand what I was ordering because anybody had never ordered it. I was so surprised that I didnâ€™t know what I could tell him. However, my brother explained him that he must only spill milk in a cup or glass. The waiter went into the bar, and a few minutes later he came back with a cup of milk, but it was so hot that I must wait for one hour for drinking it. And we ordered the bill he said the cup of milk was free because he donâ€™t know how money charge for it. The second day, we went to another bar, and I ordered again a milkshake and other waiter said again he didnâ€™t have it. And nor did he know what was a glass of milk. I began to think that was a joke. The next day the situation was replayed again in other bar with other waiter. Then, we began to laugh and the waiter became angry because he thought we were laughing at him."

I have no trouble conversing in English, but whenever I actually try to write something more than just a couple of sentences I just have no idea where to start.

Spanish,"Tagebuch 07.01.10 Hallo Freunde! Heute bin ich um 12 Uhr aufgestanden. Ja, ich weiÃŸ, das ist ja spÃ¤t, aber gestern Abend bin ich nich fruh ins Bett gegangen. Ich habe nicht sehr gut geschlafen, weil ich ein paar Male aufgewacht bin. Es war zu warm. Dann habe ich gut gefrÃ¼hstÃ¼ckt und geduscht und bin weg gegangen. Danach habe einen Freund zum Hafen beglitten, weil er den Schiff um 15.30 nehmen musste. Wir haben uns verabschiden und er ist eingestiegen. Vom Hafen habe ich einen kleinen Spaziergang gemacht bis zu McDonals, wo ich eine Freundin treffen musste. Ich bin mich in einer Buchhandlung und in einem Teehaus gehaltet. Das Teehaus war leider geschloÃŸen, weil heute Sonntaig ist. Um 16.15 habe ich meine Freunde Chris vor McDonals getroffen. Wir essen nie dort, aber es ist ein guter Treffpunkt. Wir mÃ¶chten zum Park. DafÃ¼r mussten wir den Bus nehmen, aber wir haben die falsche Linie genommen und wir mussten aufsteigen und wider auf die richtige einsteigen. Als wir endlich zum Park angekommen sind, haben wir uns ein bisschen unterhalten. Das GesprÃ¤ch war sehr angenehm. Dann mÃ¶chten wir eine heiÃŸe Schokolade trinken, aber alles war geschlossen. Als ich zurÃ¼ck nach Hause gekommen bin, habe ich abengegessen. Gestern hatte ich ""pain au chocolat"" gebacken. Sie sind kleine Tasche aus BlÃ¤tterteig gefÃ¼llte mit Schokolade. Die waren meine ersten. Das heiÃŸ, das war das erste mal, dass ich sie gebacken habe. Sie waren nicht perfekt aber sie waren gut! Ich habe eine gegessen. Lecker!"

Spanish,"My first post in this site Hello, I'm writing down my first post in this site in order to see if it works properly, that is, if I can use it to improve my writing skills and, also, to help others to improve their skills writing my lovely native language, Catalan. By the way, as many Catalan speakers suffer, we also could correct Spanish entries but it seems that, since we can only choose one language to correct, we can not select it. Does anybody know how to fix this?"
Spanish,"DonÂ´t have words There are more than 5000 languages in the world and none of them is exactly a copy of other. All languages share tons of characteristics; they have verbs, adjectives, adverbs, a subject, pronouns, nouns, etc. But when you compare languages in a deeper level their differences make a huge difference. Languages are close related or not event related because of the language they come from. Ones come from Latin and others from Germanic but even when they come from different languages they share quite a lot of aspects. I personally think they all come from a common language nobody has ever discovered. When somebody wants to learn a language, they use their native tongue in order to learn a second language so they have the basis to build on the structure of a new language. Yet the main problem lies in some aspects languages do not share at all. It may be that one language locates its verbs at the end of the sentence while the other set them at the very beginning of the sentence. Some languages may not have articles and instead they use particles to cover this problem which at the end is not a problem but the way that language works. Culture is close related to languages, because somehow culture is created by culture and culture is built in language. So, the way people think is the way they see the world that surround them through language. No one would see a world if they do not have a language first, due to the lack of previous knowledge. Without the word â€œtableâ€ and the phonetic sound /(tÄÂ´bÉ™l)/ this person could never know that this object (the table) is a table itself. He may call it by his own personal way but what he would be doing in that moment is creating a language for himself in order to name things. Concordantly, language is a social aspect the human life, and the agreement of use is something that people should do in order to settle a official language. All the population of certain place should agree that table is â€œan article of furniture supported by one or more vertical legs and having a flat horizontal surface.â€ So everyone could communicate and talk about tables. But we all agree that in this world as, as we told before, there is not only one language and what is a table in English is a â€œmesaâ€ in Spanish and â€œãƒ†ãƒ¼ãƒ–ãƒ«â€ (teeburu) in Japanese and none of them share even the same words. Then how do these words mean the same but they are written using different characters? The answer is quite simple, language have they own words to name things, as simple as that. If a language would use words from other language to name every of its items, it may use as well use the same grammar and syntax and the result would be two identical languages which will end in a fusion of them and the creating of, not a new language, the same language. That is why languages are so different and with it the way people sees the world. As we said before, language share common characteristics but as they do this, they also have differences not only in their structure but in their vocabulary as well and this creates problems when learning languages. Letâ€™s say we have a word for â€œdadâ€ in English and we use it just like that, to name the person we grew up with, who teach us what we know and who we consider our father. So we call â€œdadâ€ that person, using examples such as: my dad, his dad, her dad, etc. But what happens when we want to learn the Japanese word for â€œdadâ€? Well, we face the problem that they do not only have one word for â€œdadâ€ but many. All depending in the social status, the respect and the closeness you have with that person. So here we have the same person who we would call â€œdadâ€ in England or United States but that in Japan we should call him â€œã¡ã¡â€ (chichi), â€œã‚ãµâ€ (afu), â€œã ã„ãµâ€ (taifu), â€œã¡ã¡ãŠã‚„â€ (chichioya), â€œã¨ã†ã•ã‚“â€ (toosan), â€œãŠã¨ã†ã•ã¾â€ (otoosama), â€œãŠã¨ã†ã•ã‚“â€ (otoosan), etc. The later aspect does not mean the Japanese have more fathers than we do, but that they have different ways to call him taking in consideration details to name him that way. It can be if he is my father or is the father of my friend, or if it is the father of my new friend. All these characteristics are fully taken in consideration when Japanese people talk but when we do we just skip not because we lack the knowledge to notice them but because in â€œour worldâ€ we do not see this aspects in such a general and important way. Not only we can talk about single items of vocabulary, but letÂ´s imagine we have two people talking about colors, a type of red color to paint one the peopleÂ´s house. Then one of them says: I want the color red that we see every day when the sunsets. That sentence â€œthe color red that we see every day when the sunsetsâ€ could be described in Japanese with only one word but not necessarily using such a long sentence. Why is this? Because Japanese may see this color using one word because in â€œtheir worldâ€ that color does not reflects the sunset but just a color. Japanese language has no difference between the colors blue and green and it is not that they do not have those two colors because they have them, but it is just that they have one single word to describe both (aoi). Maybe because of the globalization they needed at some point to create a word to make a difference (midori) but it was because of necessity and not self creation that they did. I personally think our language do not lack of word to describe things or have more words to describe things, it is just the way people see the word the way they call things. It is their necessities what makes them create new words or have words to call thing we may not even need. But when we do, we may use a previous created word or just invent one for ourselves."
Spanish,"SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH Scientific researches are necessary to improve the quality of people's life, but reserch need to be funded . Some people suggest that Government should carried out the investigations while others think the opposite. I firmily believe that scientific studies shoul be funded by both the Government and private corporation according to the kind of research. On one hand, Governments should be in charge of running basic researches such as national defense and enviromental issue because these topics have national effect . So, they required national attention. In fact, if Governments do not invest in the development of millitary intelligent strategies, for example, It will be very dangerous for the state, likewise, the environmental issue is of national interest therefore national institutions and universities should carry out studies to tackle this issue. On the other hand,Private Institutions tend to devote to profit oriented researches . They continuously invest money to discover new products . A good example of this are the drug companies that carried out investigations to find new cures for diseases that effect the most people. These companies benefits individuals with the cure and make profit for themselves. To sum up, Scientific research should have research funding from Goverments and private institutions. They both have specific areas to investigate and their active involvement is the key to the development of the world."

First, It's ecologic that's means that i'm an ecologic girl because I give some help to the planet. Second, because this notebook says my name and my name is pretty weird in my country. I love it. I bought two draw's pencils because my sister is an artist, well she loves to draw anime's characters. She's so good drawing also my brother I am the only one in my family who cant draw well. After the stationery my mom and I went to the chicken's restaurant and we bought chicken for the dinner.

Spanish,"Courses, courses and more courses. It've been a long time since a wrote my last entry. I've been a bit busy and a bit run out of ideas. During this time I had finished to work as au pair and came back to Spain. I also studied a plumbing course (I am not a very common girl, you can see) and a computing course. I'm usually doing courses and more courses. I love doing it, I'm a very curious woman and I love learning new things. So, I was finishing my job in UK and coming back to Spain. The first thing I did was looking for a new job (with no luck) and then looking for a new course (hehe). Maybe I must start saying that I studied a kind of interior designer in Alicante, which was very interesting but we had very poor technology teaching so I think I need more technology knowledge in plumbing, electricity or building. And that was the reason for me studying plumbing! :D. Plumbing was quite interesting and I wasn't the only girl in the class like I was afraid of. A peruan woman in her fifties also studied with me and it was very encouraging seeing a mother like her studying what she like without worrying about female and male jobs. As well, our classmates were very fairly and didn't judge us and we made a fantastic job in our practice workshop. And the computing course was Macromedia Flash MX and now I know how to make my own gifs, I'm so happy!! Here you are my first gif, it's not a art work but I'm a bit overexcited with it, haha."

And actually Spain they donÂ´t speak Spanish ( they wonÂ´t say that theyspeak Spanish but ""Castellano"".) Nevertheless is the same, Castellano and Spanish are the same. Anyway I am going to write this because of a simple thing, that most ofÂ people that is learning Spanish should know. This is common in Mexico, Peru, Argentina, well all Latin America. (I donÂ´t know in Spain) What is an Adverb? According to the RAE (Real Academia de la lengua EspaÃ±ola) an adverb is: Adverbio. (Del lat. adverbÄ­um). 1. m. Gram. PALABRA INVARIABLE cuya funciÃ³n consiste en complementar la significaciÃ³n del verbo, de un adjetivo, de otro adverbio y de ciertas secuencias. Hay adverbios de lugar, como aquÃ­, delante, lejos; de tiempo, como hoy, mientras, nunca; de modo, como bien, despacio, fÃ¡cilmente; de cantidad o grado, como bastante, mucho, ....................... http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=adverbio If you donÂ´t get Spanish enough the only part you must get is this one; PALABRA INVARIABLE (Invariable word.) So is a word you CANÂ¨T modify (let me laugh! hahahahahahahahhahahahahah) If you have been in Mexico or some country in Latin America, I bet you have hear the word ""ahorita"", and perhaps because of the compound of letters you might know that comes from ""ahora"" (now/ right now) but if you look it into the dictionary that word must be between ""ahora"" and ""ahorcar"" (to hang). So is that a word?, yeah!!!!, is that an adverb? Of course it is!!!!!! Is it used in the common language? Are you kidding? Is indispensable to know that word!!! This takes us to other problem (if you want to call it problem) the ""diminutive"" of the words. In English we have a word like ""little"" that helps us to say that the dog in little, ""Ahh that little dog"". And in Spanish we have the suffixes ""ito"" and ""ita"", so if we want to say that the dog is little we can say either: el pequeÃ±o perro or el perro chiquito/pequeÃ±ito. So the diminutive is most common in Latin America, and is most realted with baby stuff and women, (this doesnÂ´t mean that men can say it, you can, just that you must know when you can say it. ""If you want me to make a list when you can and when you canÂ´t, just ask for it"") and theseÂ ""ito and ""ita"" sound lovely. But ok, you can modify nouns, and adjetives, but ADVERBS? Yeahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! you can!!!!!! Well at least with ""ahora"" you can!! Ahora=ahorita=Ahorititita!!! You must be asking WTF is that!!!! And you are right, WTF is that? Well the only thing I can say is..... that ahorititita is an adverb. How can I learn words like that in every language, well, perhaps you have either of two options,; go to the country they say that, or get a girlfriend/boyfriend from that country. Why this? Because who uses this kind of words? THE PEOPLE!!!! and only the people, the user of that language, not the textbooks. So get involve into the language enviroment. And remember every language has dialects and every dialect has its own dialects. And like a person in Peru answered to this question once: Â¿CuÃ¡ntos hijos tiene usted?(how many children do you have? = Tenguito solamentito dositos hijitos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (I little have little two little sons.) WTF the verb is modified!!!! You can modify everything but that doesnÂ´t mean it is correct. So if you are learning Spanish you have a long, long road in front of you. LikeÂ me, I am learning Japanese and I know that I have a massive road in front of me. Actually Spanish scary me even when I am native speaker. You donÂ´t realized what you are talking until you start searching into the language, then you will notice that your language is not as easy as the phrase ""la casa es azul"" (the blue house). DonÂ´t give up and keep fighting, and you will get it. So if you have questions about the Spanish language spoken in Mexico, you can ask me, and I will respond you."
Spanish,"Dreaming I was dreaming just some hours ago about being in a water riding coaster style park!!! was so much fun. different games between a ride and water plays. I finally got dizzy of so much movement. well and I woke up; Had a great breakfast at subway with my love and I'm back home. I had dreamt before about that park, the new ride was insane! sadly I couldn't find it because I woke up! but I was in the lane just about to get to it. It's funny how dreams can be related and interconnected; mixing reality and a different complete unusual logical interrelations. Sometimes I dreamt and then I realized that I dreamt about it because I saw that on TV or someone talk to me about this other thing and in my dream they appeared mixed in something fantastic and in a way that I have never thought about it. Well was a fun dream this night!"
Spanish,"Christmas in Colombia In Colombia, we celebrate Christmas on the 24th. The gifts are opened at midnight and every one is hungover for the 25th. Christmas is very different from the way the US celebrates it. My family was very poor and I lived in a small town. My mom was a dress maker. Our tradition is that on the 24th, you were new clothes, go to church and party like crazy. I was the happiest little girl wearing my new outfits. I would also get a new outfit for New Year's Eve and that would be the two only new outfits I would get for the rest of the year. Santa Clause did not gave us presents. That guy was only in movies. We got presents from Baby Jesus. However, my mom used to tell me that since Baby Jesus was so poor and he lived in a stable, he did not have money for a gift that year. It was not important if I did not get a gift because my cousins did so we would play with their toys in the 25th. The 24th was only work for my mother . Many people asked her to make new clothes for that night but they payed her during the next year. Then, my mom used the sewing machine until 11:30pm. At 11:30, she would say ""Feliz Navidad"" to us and hide because she hated to interact with so many people. For the rest of the neighborhood, people would dance, drink and eat the whole night. When it was midnight, everyone would go from house to house to say ""Feliz Navidad"" with a kiss and a hug. Without exaggerating, everyone would kiss and hug at least 40 people from midnight to 1am. The next day, the 25th, was for people to sleep all they wanted and cure their hungover. For that, some families went to the pool or the river and cook grilled meet or make a delicious Sancocho. I am not sure if I miss all that. It was always very intense. However, my Colombians friends will be in a big party tonight while I will be going out for dinner and going to the movies."

Spanish,"hwk essay Prompt: It is said that the United States is the land of opportunity, and many immigrants have found it. However, some immigrants have not always been welcomed. They have faced hardships because of discrimination. Write an essay where you narrate an incident where you, or a family relative, or a friend experienced discrimination. Are we all equals before the law? Even though The Constitution of The United States of America clearly states that we are all equals before the law, it seems that this constitutional right it is not completely truth, almost every Latino immigrant have suffered some kind of discrimination by a government agency. In a recent survey most Latino immigrants have reported some cases of discrimination by the police department (local or state) and from the immigration service. Policemen are on the streets to protect us from the criminals, but for most Latinos the police department is a synonym of discrimination. There have been a lot of reports spread by the press of police abuse against immigrants all over the country. The most commons police abuses are: First, arresting Latinos immigrants only for their look, it looks like being a Latino make you a suspect of any crime on the vicinity , and second, arresting them simply because some immigrants do not speak English, and by consequence cannot defend their selves from the accusations. I have not been arrested on my entire life, and have never had a problem with the police in my home country or in the US, but there was this time when a white lady hit me on the road, and despite the police officer saw the whole thing, he did not give the white lady a ticket. He was very gently with her and very rude with me. He even harassed me telling me if I donâ€™t leave the accident scene he will blame me for the accident. I told him that I was going to take the incident to court, and he told me that the judge will believe anything he tells him. And you know what the judge did; he believes the policeman history and gave me a nice fine and a couple of points in my license for reckless driving. I believe the policeman treat me like that because of my Latino accent. I felt so discriminated at that time. Another government institution beside the police departments that is known by its habits in discriminating Latino immigrants is the department of immigration and homeland security. It seems that they think that all the Latinos in the United States are illegal immigrants. One of my friends once told me that he had been arrested for the department of immigration. They took him away from his job and sent him to one of their facility for interrogation, my friend at that time had a green card but he never carry it around because he was afraid of losing it. He finally called his wife, who grabbed his green card from their home and took it to him. He was release and they gave him an apology. He believes that they arrested him only because he did not speak English. Finally, Even though the US constitution makes us equals, some government agencies make Latino immigrants different. It is already hard to leave our countries, came to America to work very hard, learned a new language and adopted a new culture, for some bureaucratic and inefficient institutions making it harder."

Spanish,"Traditional Peruvian Food ""Santiago Queirolo"" The best traditional peruvian food of all the places i've already ate. It's mostly a very good place where you can enjoy our traditional dishes. It's located in the San Martin 1062 avenue Pueblo Libre. Particularly, they have a great and good variety of food, a big menu of traditional meals and dishes such as papa rellena, ceviche, butifarra and one of the most famous is ""choritos a la chalaca"". The whole place has an structure of our colonial time! i think is one of the only places in the capital city that maintains these traditions. Inside of the restaurant, you will see many pictures about the time when this place was under construction, pictures of our first monorail, the first cars in peru, etc. The place is quite small but very comfortable. The waiters are a bit old but they are really good. I feel very pleasant every time i go there, you can't not only find out about our food, but also you can find out a little bit about our history! and there are a lot of foreigners going there as well. The price it's quite normal and i find it reasonable since they cook very well.. I would like to recommend this restaurant for all the tourists who are coming to visit Peru, if you plan to fill your stomach with something tradtional, fast, unique and good with such a ancient place like this, don't hesistate and go find it out for your own."
Spanish,"visiting a castle When I was a child, I used to spend my holidays in my grandmother's village with my parents. I remember a time that we went to a castle near there that is almost abandoned. It is a great stone building that have four tower, one in every corner, and his walls are broad. Around it, there are a small village. When we arrived in this village, my father asked a neighbor who was in the village's square about how we could go up the castle. The old man gave us a huge and ancien key and told us when we would arrive up, we would open the door with it. Going to the castle was tiring, but was amazing because it was like we had turned to medieval times. While my parents saw it quietly, my brother and I ran up and down by a lot of steps until my brother fell and he did a injury in his knee. At this moment, my father became angry and shouted to us that we must to return at home. Fortunely, I encouraged my father to go to the castle again the next day."
Spanish,"Conferences During the weekend of March 12-13, 2010, I had a great experience when I attended the 2010 annual conference â€œDiscovering the Power of Languageâ€ given by the Foreign Language Association of Georgia (FLAG). There were two talks that I enjoyed very much. First, I was inspired by the talk given by Greg Sanchez, â€œThe Joy of Writing and Singing your own Songs! No Experience Necessary!â€. There, I learned that many popular songs use simple musical structures, which I can use to make my own songs. For example, I can create a different version of the song â€œLa bambaâ€. Mr. Sanchez gave us a PowerPoint with a tool that can play important guitar notes. We can use these important notes to play a song. During this, talk we created lyrics for some popular songs and it was very entertaining. Second, I was impressed with the activities presented by Cynthia Alby and others, â€œTeaching Vocabulary to Tactile and Kinesthetic Learnersâ€. They explained that many students in our classrooms are tactile/kinesthetic learners, but most vocabulary instructions and review is geared toward visual or auditory learners. During their talk, we experience hands-on vocabulary activities. I remember very vividly how we wrote short words on our partners back using our fingers while our partner had to guess what word it was. The purpose of the activity was to practice the spelling of new vocabulary words. I thought it was a very interesting approach for teaching vocabulary."

Spanish,"""TAPAS"" My friends know that IÂ´m spanish and I want to share with you some word we have here:""Tapas"". If you look at the dictionary the meaning is something that cover the saucepan. But the other meaning we have is more interesting. When people think about Spain they think in different words... maybe: flamenco dance, bullfighter, nap,tapas... but today I want to tell you where it comes from the word ""tapas"". A long time ago when people was going to the bar and asked a wineÂ´s glass , the waiter served the glass cover with a piece of ham. And why that? For the flies. The flies were one of the problems they had and I donÂ´t think they had healthy conditions. Nowadays, we say ""tapas"" ,small portions of distinct dishes or traditional products. They are often taken in midday from noon until dinner time. Tapas were served for free when you asked for an alcoholic drink. Now is not so common to be free, we have to pay if we want they serve. There are a variety of ""tapas"" . You can make ""tapas"" with all types of food. I loved to eat only with ""tapas"" ,itÂ´s the way to eat a lot of different things."
Spanish,"We may win a trip to NY! I'm participating in a university contest involving some tests (I don't feel test is the best word... can you think of a better one?), all about the Millenium Objetives stated by the UNO. After each team submits its proposal, there's a week for the people to vote their faouvorite on the web. After that, a jury scores/rates each one, and so the winner for each test is chosen. There's a final prize for the three ones scoring highest at the end of the contest: they all can enrol for free in a postgrade major course (or a language one, if they haven't finished their career). Additionally, the first team get to travel to New York! We won last test, and each of the components of our team got a mobile phone. As I had just bought a Motorola Milestone (the european version of Droid), I gave it to my father, who's actually very happy with it, since it's a cute small nokia with wifi. We go firsts now, but since they try to give one prize to a different team each time, we expect the jury to make the ones who go third win this time. But we still hope we win at last and visit USA!!

Spanish,"My favorite books Recently I was reading Harry Potter books. Well, I should say that I read all the books around five times each one. But I read them in spanish.

For example, spanish for Death Eaters is ""MortÃ­fagos"", or spanish for portkey is ""traslador"".

Spanish,"Amazed by Juan Rulfo Amazed by Juan Rulfo Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez The day I discovered Juan Rulfo will be, without any doubts, a main chapter in my memories, as the day I discovered Franz Kafka. I will tell the story. I had arrived to MÃ©xico the same day that Ernest Hemingway killed himself with a gunâ€™s shot, on July 2, 1961; and I have to admit that I hadnâ€™t read Rulfoâ€™s books yet, and whatâ€™s more I hadnâ€™t even heard anything about him. I lived in an apartment, without elevator, on RenÃ¡n Street, in Anzures colony. We had a double matrix on the floor in the main dormitory, a cradle in the other room, and a table in the living room, with only two chairs that were useful for all, where I ate and wrote. I was 32 years old. I had made a brief journalist career in Colombia. I had just stayed three useful and hard years in Paris, and eight months in New York. In that moment, I just wanted to write movie scripts in Mexico. The atmosphere literary in Mexico in those days were very similar to ColombiaÂ´s; and I felt great among them. Six years before I had published my first novel, â€œThe Leaf Stormâ€, and I also had three unpublished books: â€œNo One Writes to the Colonelâ€, that appeared in that time in Colombia, â€œIn Evil Hourâ€, that was published by Era Editorial, later by Vicente Rojo; and finally a short stories collection, â€œBig Mamaâ€™s Funeralâ€. So I was a writer with five underground books, but it was not my real problem, since I hadnâ€™t became a writer in order to become famous, but to be loved by my friends a little more. I thought that I had already achieved that. My big problem as a novelist was that after those books I felt to be in a blind alley. I was looking everywhere how to escape from that. I already knew those good and bad authors that could have teach me something, and, I felt spinning in concentric circles, although. I didnâ€™t consider myself exhausted; on the contrary, I felt that I still had to write many additional books. It was just that I hadnâ€™t found a convenient and poetic way to write them. I was that way, when Ãlvaro Mutis went upstairs seven floors to my apartment with a box full of books. He looked inside for the smallest one and gave it to me and told me with a smile on his face, â€œRead this thing, so that you can learn how to writeâ€. It was â€œPedro PÃ¡ramoâ€ by Juan Rulfo. This is a translation. http://www.ciudadseva.com/textos/teoria/opin/ggm6.htm"

He used to be part of TEAM A, and that`s pretty much what the first half is about, and then he moved and started the new TEAM B. Eisa is a type of okinawan dance were they use taiko drums.>> Greeting Leader's Greeting My first encounter with the Eisa was back in summer of 2003, when I watched a TEAM A Tokyo Chapter performance for the first time. Under the blazing sun, the group performed with such an intensity that overwhelmed me, and from that day onwards I became a regular spectator of their performances. The following year, I was accepted as a member, and along with the everyday practices I had the chance to stand (appear/ perform?) in many different events and festivals. In 2008, I became Sub-Leader and took the responsibility of transferring everything the older members of the team had tough us to the next generation. I hold dear many precious memories of my experience there. From now on, as leader of TEAM B, I strive to making the most out of my experience in TEAM A and taking it to the next level. My goal is to grow (raise?) a group whose performances can move and impress everyone watching. The formation of TEAM B could not have been possible without the support and aid of many people, which I am most thankful to. Also, as regards to the kindness and warmth we receive from the people who come to see our performances we cannot possibly put our appreciation into words, but instead, into every beat of the Taiko drum we hold, and into every step of our dances, with all of our might (we thank you?). <<This last paragraph may need a lot of work, am I using the word perform too much? I cannot find a suitable synonym. Thank you!!!!>>"
Spanish,"The gold girder Today I'm going to tell you about a very interesting story that belongs to the popular literature of my little coutry. You can usually read it in Galician, the Galicia's language, but I'll try to write it in English. In our country, there are a lot of ancient estructures that were built before the roman conquest. Their name is ""castros"", and it's said that they were buit by an ancient culture, probably linked to the celts. But the legend says that under these structures you can find a lot of treasures and marvelous things. There is an only little problem: if you try getting them, you could be buried alive and die in the dephts of earth. The fact is, according to these stories, that there exist tunnels where the girders were made in gold. They are called in Galician language ""Trabes de ouro"". But is very dangerous to try getting the girders. Indeed, according to the popular stories, there are some of them that were made in coal tar, and a mechanism involves them in flames if somebody touch them. I am not trying to frighten you, but, although many people went to looking for these treasures, almost nobody returned alive, and who did it had become crazy."

Nationalists couldn't to take up Madrid because republicans resisted with help of URSS. Then, nationalists tried to cut off Madrid. Nationalists lost the â€œBatalla del Jaramaâ€ and â€œBatalla de Guadalajaraâ€ in 1936. URSS and French helped republicans with International Brigades and tanks called, T-24. Mussolini helped nationalists with tanks called â€œFiat Ansaldoâ€. Hitler too helped nationalists with a terrible troop called Condor Legion. The next objective of nationalists was to take up the north of Spain. The Condor Legion bombed Gernika, and Picasso painted it. Spain was divided in half, so Nationalists began the attack of the Mediterraneo to cut off the republic zone in 1938. Republicans knew that they were losing then they began the battle of the Ebro. Republicans army was massacred and nationalists army could to take up all Catalonia. Republican zone didn't have aliments and the people was hungry. In April of 1939 nationalists won the war and, they took up all Spain without resistence."
Spanish,"About Extra Textual Analysis Performing extra textual analysis on a text is fundamental in both translation of natural sciences texts and social sciences texts. Extra textual analysis is a powerful and essential tool for fulfilling a fine translation of a given text, since before of translating a text it is necessary to understand it. It can not be said that extra textual analysis is more complex in one type of text than in the other one. In both of the two types of texts is presented a rich amount of extra textual information such as cultural aspects or relationships among the different fields of the science. For example, in the paper, â€œSalvador DalÃ­ or the Persistence of Memories â€“True and Falseâ€, it is vital to be aware of who Sigmund Freud, AndrÃ© Breton and Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca were, besides it is important to posses a knowledge of the Surrealist Movement, since DalÃ­ was one its main members. To understand and then translate this article it is necessary to know about DalÃ­ personality which was always very close to his pieces of work. If you misunderstand what the author are saying, then some mistakes in the translation could appear. In the text, â€œCloning Protocol of Aloe Vera as a Study-Case for â€˜Tailor-Madeâ€™ Biotechnology to Small Farmersâ€, the translator should be aware of some fields of the biology as biotechnology and cloning. It is not enough to translate what an author says in his text, the translator should be a kind of erudite and know the relationships among the text he is translating and other similar texts."

Spanish,"Magicians. Today I am going to tell you about magicians and magic. I am a magician but it is not my job, I work in other matter related with laws. When I was twelve years old I found a magic book in my grandfatherÂ´s library: ""Magia, Ilusionismo y PrestidigitaciÃ³n"" ( I don't translate this words because the three mean the same in english) of Antonio de Armenteras. I read it very quicly. It was fantastic... but I left the hobbie. Some years later, when I was twenty-three years old I recovered the hobbie. I bought one book : ""Cartomagia fundamental"" (Basic magic with cards) of Vicente Canuto and I bought some decks to practice. Today I have a lot of books of magic, over thirty. I am a good magician and I enjoy when people enjoy watching my performances. If sometime you are in Sevilla and you want to enjoy, contact with me. We can have one or two beers while I am acting for you. Thank you for read and correct."

However, next Friday (November 5th) I was invited by two people to their houses. The first person was a friend from school who already graduated. She invited me to stay at her house and drink with some other ex classmates. It sounded very fun so I say that it was very likely that I would be there. However, a German friend is leaving for a couple of months and she just sent me an e-mail inviting me to her farewell party. I would really like to go to both places but they are very far so I have to cancel one. I will go to the farewell party because I feel bad not going. Sadly, I will have to cancel my girl's nigh out with my school friends. Hopefully, we will be able to party together again. I just wish this two events were not in the same day."

Spanish,"Hello everyone! First entry in Lang-8 Hi there! My name is Esteban and I'm writing here for the very first time... I was dragged here by Tofugu this certain guy who vloggs and gives away resources to those who are self-teaching themselves Japanese online. Textfugu, is his website. Good that I knew him so I can give it a try to this Lang-8 thing. I am also fond of Japan and Korea but at the time I am not studying these languages although I expect to start studying them soon. In the mean time I'll write over here to perfect my English. Actually ""perfect"" is a word too heavy to carry around. I'll say then that I want to learn more and more! :D It's been aproximately 4 years since I formally started studying English but I almost never have the chance to be corrected when I practice either because my friends are too kind to me or because I don't usually write letters or any document in English or beacause I am not understood. :( I want to write over here every now and then and become more confident in my writing. Also I really enjoy practicing and sharing stuff in this my second language. I look forward to being corrected and to have my most common mistakes pointed out. I think I can take that as long as you don't go too hard on me. I thank you all in advance and I hope to know more about you over here. I am at your disposition if you ever need a native Spanish speaker. I'm from Mexico BTW but since I study literature (esp. playwriting) I think I can be very useful if ever required by you no matter which spanish you are learning. My spelling is one little problem I have and that is one thing I believe is important for me to be advised in. Since I've been learning from teachers who thaught both American and British English the outcome of my writing might be a strange strange mixture them. I want to be consistent with BrE since the last two years I've been learning under a British-like system, but well, that's too much to say in a firts entry. I know it might be difficult to explain to me every error y might do... so I thank you again if you can comment me. Oh boy am I nervous!! O_O :) Thanks a bunch! Esteban"
Spanish,"Translation: Portugal Portugal is situated on the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula; it borders Spain to the north and east; and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south. The two largest cities in Portugal are Lisbon and Porto. Although Lisbon is the official capital and the center of southern Portugal, Porto is considered by the people of the north as the most important city. The situation of Lisbon is splendid, built as it is, for the most part, on high ground on the banks of the Tagus. Porto, further north, also enjoys a splendid situation. It stands on the steep banks of the Douro River, between which two high bridges have been built. ******* Portugal estÃ¡ situado sobre la costa occidental de la PenÃ­nsula IbÃ©rica; limita con EspaÃ±a por el norte y el este; y con el OcÃ©ano AtlÃ¡ntico por el oeste y el sur. Las dos ciudades mayores de Portugal son Lisboa y Oporto. Aunque Lisboa es la capital oficial y el centro del sur de Portugal, Oporto es considerada por los habitantes del norte como la ciudad mÃ¡s importante. La situaciÃ³n de Lisboa es esplÃ©ndida, construida como estÃ¡, en su mayor parte, en un terreno elevado a orillas del Tajo. Oporto, mÃ¡s al norte, disfruta tambiÃ©n de una situaciÃ³n esplÃ©ndida.

Spanish,"Trials help us to overcome In my opinion, the trials is always in our life but is very importand learn to overcome and deal. First, a lot of people has many problems in their life. For example, if you have a litle problem in your work or in your family you have to find the solution but if you canÂ´t do it alone, perhaps you could talk to someone like your friend or family member to help you find a solution or give you some good advice. Second,This life is very important to overcome the evidence day by day get in our way helps us overcome them grow and mature as people. For example,If you want to be someone in life you have to go through many obstacles whether personally and in terms of work, if we are to succeed in your life have to be much effort in the end all sacrifice has its rewards.

Spanish,"Music in Other Languages I remember those year in high school when I did not know English. I always thought it was cool to be able to understand other languages. I spent hours listening to songs in English, finding their lyrics, translating them, and try to sing them. I thought music was better when it was a challenge. Now, I think music in English or Spanish is OK. However, my interest has shifted towards other languages. Now, I spend hours trying to sing along with Korean and Chinese songs. I can read and pronounce the romanized lyrics but I do not know what I am saying most of the time. I find very funny that what I am looking for is otherness. I think I fall into the trap of exoticizing other languages. Anyway, that is what motivates me to investigate other languages and cultures."

Spanish,"ItÂ´s time to change I had to write this for my english class, I hope you could help me with my writing, Thank you! Its time to changeâ€¦ with this sentence the first thing that comes to my mind is a song from Juanes (the colombian singer). Have you ever hear about this song? I know that is a stupid comparation, but it is a very famous song and always is in the radio. Even if it is a song from Juanes, I think that the context and the meaning of the song have a lot of things that are true. The song said that the people in the world have forgotten the frienship, the love and other good fellings, and now the only thing that is important for us is the money and the work. In all the song he never suggest something to finish with that problem, well, yes he did but it is a very corny solution. In my personal point of view the only way to change it is start with us. If I donÂ´t have the intention to change with little things I canÂ´t change the biggest. Anyway, the sentence Its time to change makes me think in how difficult is try to start something to change. Because we can change many things, like superficial things, like a cellphone, a computer, a dress, etc. We can change habits too, like the sport we practice, the school where we go, or the serie that we watch on tv. But I think that Its time to change it is referring to something biggest, like our bahavior in the world. ThatÂ´s why I donÂ´t know how to complete the sentence, I donÂ´t have any idea about how the people or even how I can change something to become better. Maybe now, with the simple fact to do my homework IÂ´m doing something to change my own person, and maybe this would be good for the future of myself and my country or the human thinkâ€¦ but who knows."
Spanish,"Colors IÂ´m a woman and I like to buy clothes and things make me feel better. And I like clothes with bright colors, not so much but.... you know, not only dark colors. I use to wear them but I combine with others too. I donÂ´t think you show your mood with this, but for me is good to see people with beautiful colors. ItÂ´s like their mood is better that day. I donÂ´t think is true, but I read that people in places with good weather they have less depression. Maybe itÂ´s not true but maybe they have less colds.:)) Can change our mood with colors, weather and things like this?"

Spanish,"I love radio!! o( >_< )0 I love it because I can learn new things about the world. I can hear the popular music, the news and some curiosities. xD I love to listen the radio at the night for two reasons. There is two radio stations, one of them the announcer (locutora) speaks in English, and sometime I can understand and others I have to investigate the things. The second reason is for the music, the music in the night is in other languages like English o German, and they play 60's-90's music. I love that kind of music xD I don't know why but I love it. I'm listening a radio station called exa. fm (it is on Internet too). They are playing some weird music. The weirdest is that I'm singing xD. My family watch me in a weird way when I sing. It's ok. My voice is awful. And the most part of time I can't pronounce the words but I do my best effort. I really want to learn. Thanks for reading this entry. Have a nice day. What kind of music do you like? or What kind of music do you listen? Can you answer that question?"

I am extremely happy and I am looking forward to attending the course in Australia. The first thing I would like to inform you of is that making the trip in August would be more convenient for me and for the company I work for, as in September I am usually very busy and have more responsibilities. On top of that (I wanted to use a synonym of ""In addition"", but I don't know if it's a formal linking word), it may also be of great importance for you to know that I would prefer to attend the speaking and listening classes because I ought to improve my conversational skills in my day-to-day life. With respect to the afternoon activities you mentioned in your e-mail, I would like to inform you that I would rather make a radio programme (I'm using the BrE spelling but I know in Ame you say ""program"") and learn to play a musical instrument, as both activities might offer me the possibility of boosting my confidence and my interpersonal skills. Finally, I would appreciate it if you could inform me about the accommodation available as well as what items of clothing I should take with me. I look forward to your reply at your earliest convenience. Yours sincerely, Daniel"

Iâ€™ve been studying English since 1st grade. I like people correcting my writing in Spanish and English. Usually, I use Wordâ€™s spelling check, but sometimes when you correct it the meaning of the sentence changes. So, I also like friends and other people to check it for me so I can have a different opinion about it. I really like writing in the Internet. What I normally use is Facebook and Twitter; hopefully Iâ€™ll like posting here in Lang-8 too! This is a new experience for me, because on the other WebPages I have privacy settings and only some people can read my posts; in here I hope to get as many opinions as possible to improve as much as I can."

Spanish,"Using the internet to learn a new language Some people say learn a new language requires a lot of work and dedication, and is probably true! Beside the internet and movies I've seen in English, I was in a institute for 3 years learning English by reading and memorize its grammar. I don't like that system, so I've decided to learn Japanese without any instructor or institute, first just for fun, but rapidly I was immersed in japanese culture and customs. Learn a language does't imply just learn vocabulary and grammar, It involves the culture and people behind a particular communication system. I'm just a beginner now, but with a little help around forums and talks perhaps I would speak Japanese quicker than people who go in a institute 2 times per week."
Spanish,"Short I'm also learning (trying) Japanese. It's a beautiful language, its writing is simply amazing. I already know some colors like blue (aoi), brown (chaiiro), green (midori), orange (orenjiru), black (kuroi) and white (shiroi). It has been fun so far and I'm very excited learning this mysterious and hard language. Bye (Sayounara)."

Spanish,"Love letters Love letters are normally too sentimental and full of words that once you read them again after some time you realize how silly and embarrased they make you feel. This summer I was far from the city and had little communication with most of the people I normally talked to. So I dedicated some of my writting. One of the few pieces of writing wasa kind of love letter I had never written before. I tipied it on one notepad and I titled it ""I love you"". It said: ""Only a pair of calls is not enough, knowing you are far away is not enouegh neither. I feel you beside me when the distance is short, and I really missed you when we are too far away. I'm happy when we meet, but it really hurts me when I see you leave. I love you."" Of course it onle a kind of translation of what I wrote, and it was inspired in one person. However after finding it in my files and reading it, I still feel it is like the kind of stupid thing you write without sense when you feel inspired. ^^U..

I am from Hon Kong and studying in Japan now. I have studied Japanese for more than 6 years, and passed JLPT level 1. But there is still room of improvement. Besides, I have been interested in learning German for a long time, but there has been no chance for me to attend a regular course. I am trying to study it by myself now. So, any one who is native German speaker or can speak German, please give me some advise~lol. The materials I am using now are movies in German and wikipedia~lol I think movies are good tools to learn languages. Because we can observe the motion and emotion and gesture and everything else on the screen to guess the meaning of a word that we don't know. What about everybody else? How do you self study a language? Oh, I almost forgot to say, I am still on my way to ""ultimate English""~ My goal is to use English same as native speakers. I can speak well, but I still need to improve my writing and reading. ( my vocabulary is horrible when compared to people who are at same level as me~lol)"

Cantonese,"Roads after Guaduation Today, I saw those university students have their photoes taken in the campus. Big smiles and ambition, which have shown on their faces. I don't know whether it is a good symptom. Looking around the campus, unemployment is seen everywhere. There is even a saying goes, graduation means unemployment. Of course, dark side doesn't control everything, because some excellent students do abtain good occupations in large companies, and some even open up their small factories. however, not everyone is excellent in a society. From their smile and ambitious, I can image the picture of brave Polish chavalis in World War2. Some of them were lucky enough to chase with Russian infantry, but others just met a disaster, which was panzers. Anyway, all students have to graduate, only if you learn much and fortunate enough, you may at last get over the catastrophe."

It may be a good idea that i can talk about their daily topic, so that i can use what i have just learned. Today, they are talking about tomatoes. My favorite way to eat them is to eat them raw, i like the juice and the texture. Another favourite way is to use them as a sauce, it is a good match with fish and meat.

Cantonese,"Introduction/NB to Lang-8 My friend told me about Lang-8, about how you have the native people help you with the languages. My first languages are Cantonese and Mandarin, currently living in Canada, despite I've been living in Canada for over 9 years, besides my every day speaking and reading, my writing isn't the greatest. My grammar and spelling sucks :/ I'm also learning Japanese at this moment. And yes, my Japanese Grammar is the worse! And since I came to Canada after I graduated from Grade 6 in China, now, I don't know if I should say I'm fluent with Chinese or English, and collapse with Japanese. There are so many times that I can describe something with one of these certain languages. What inspired me to learn Japanese? Yes, looking at my pic you probably know it's cuz of Anime. Well partly? My greatest inspiration was actually Digimon. Something about this series grabs me in. It didn't just inspire me to learn Japanese, it also inspires me to learn and do a lot of things. Such as I started to draw more, and I like writing stories... etc. Yes, to become an animator, was also inspired by Digimon as well. I'm an animator, I really enjoy drawing and animating, as well as writing stories.(As I mentioned that earlier, and I hate reading for some reason...) In order to improve my English writing skills, I have start to write stories with English instead of Chinese. I'm currently Working on FanFictions for Kouji X Izumi Love Stories: ""æ™‚ã‚’æµã‚Œã‚‹"" it's been on-going for over 120 something chapters, the FanFic is in Chinese. As I just started a new Digimon Novel, I should call it a FanFic as well, since alot of the characters are taken from Digimon, call ""Digimon The Knight of Sword"", typed in English. I might consider posting this story up here in the nearest future, and of course, please excuse my grammar D: And Feel free to give extra ideas and any grammar correction. Anyways~ CHEERS EVERYONE <3 -rainmon"

Cantonese,"What are important considerations in choosing a job/career according to you? Introduction I think there are some considerations in choosing a job, like the field of the job, the location of job, the satisfaction of job. First of all, It is important to consider the field of job when choosing a job, because the field is related to the future of the job. Otherwise, you may not continue it long. Secondly, the location of job is also a very essential reason. To commute your office, transportation is a big issue, if the road to your work place happens traffic frequently, which must bring you lots of inconvenience. Lastly, the job`s satisfaction is key factor to make you decide the job. If the job could satisfy you, you like it, so you can devote yourself to it voluntarily, and it will also motive you. In sum, there are many considerations to hesitate when picking up a job. As me, I will decide majorly by the field of job, the location of job, and the satisfaction of job. Of course, they are not just limited the factors that I mentioned above."

My roommates were so friendly and made me warm. But the first day at school seemed a little long. First of all, I had to clean up my drawers which I even didnâ€™t know how to start. It took me two hours to move in and moved out my motherâ€™s food and which I often companied at home. The last but not least the enormous pressure from the new semester, the difficulties for my major would be improved and I was anxious for the unknown challenge. To face the unchangeable, accept it.

Basically you can use all sorts of letters in English or numbers and even symbols like ^ and * and start designing on your own! So that's just the beginning of the story. Instead of using the combination of numbers and letters that you have created right away, you actually have to submit it to the Transport Department of Hong Kong for approval (just to make sure that it's not foul language or something I think), and they'll put it on auction where you can bid whatever you want (and you can even give up yours and bid another one lol) I've picked some number plates that I like quite a bit.

Cantonese,"Birds of a feather flock together When in primary school,we were taught to classfy different things. We had ever answer this kind of question,like that,for example,here it is an apple,a pear,an orange,a desk,now please select out a different one. Naturally,we would choose â€œthe deskâ€. In our daily life,it is not easy to see the different animals getting together,because they would always stay with whom is similar to themselves. From these phenomenon,we can make a conclusion, â€œBirds of a feather flock togetherâ€. After hearing this sentence,there is no doubt that it would remind us of another one,exactly, â€œpeople of a kind fall into the same group.â€Apart from the animals,human beings are included. In the ancient times,different countries would exist different class of people,. For instance,before our motherland was founded,bourgeois and proletarian were existing at the same time,and nowadays,proletarian can be sort into workers,farmers,merchants and so on. That is why we had this saying â€œpeople of a kind fall into the same groupâ€. Different kind of people have different ideas towards this proverb. Some people are opposed to this phenomenon because they believe different kind of people can also get well along with each other. If we always adhere what the proverb said,gradually,it is dasy to appear the ethnic discrimination,which will be detrimental to the people all over the world. Consequently,we should make an attempt to get along with other kind of people,so that we can make a harmonious world better. From my point of view,however,I think it is normal to let the same kind of people get together. First and foremost,I believe the same kind of people staying together doesnâ€™t mean they are not friendly to others. Instead,,they are making effort to preserve a better relationship with others. For example,in the industrial fields,the same kind of people getting together can use the less resources to accomplish the same product. In that way,they can be more efficient and richer. Consequently,our motherland can be stronger,other people can live more happily. So,the ethnic discrimination is not easy to happen. Secondly,this phenomenon can make people more competitive. The junior purse the lifestyle that is similar to the senior. In that way,our life will be more vivid. Generally speaking,the advantages of the same people getting together outweigh the disadvantage. So,I do subscribe to this proverb, â€œpeople of a kind fall into the same group.â€"
Cantonese,"An Impressive Night I'm going to finish this dairy with a few words here before going to bed, to express the feeling about after watching the 10th Chinese Bridge competition. I've been lazy for about 2years without doing any foreign language practices since I worked in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, 2 touching stories tonight from 2 different foreign Chinese students deeply impressed me and stirred my nerves that had been numbed for so long. Can I master a foreign language as much as the competitors do, I have to ask myself? At this moment, I know that nothing is impossible to manage when you engage in it with your whole heart and by all the efforts. Go go go, Avis. Practice everyday and improve the language from every mistake. Tomorrow is another day. Good night and have a nice sleep, everyone!"
Cantonese,"Super Market Don't Mean Super Convenience Nowadays, more and more local shops have been replaced by large supermarkets. Some people believe that supermarkets can provide more variety of merchandise as well as lower price. But I don't see eye to eye with them and I reckon that supermarkets produce more trobles than conveniences. I have two reasons to support my views. For one thing, the supermarkets are very crowded especially on weekend and holidays. Imagine that you just want to buy a bottle of water, and you have to wait for more than half an hour to stand in the line at the cashier. For another, generally speaking, sipermarkets are far away, some people have to drive a long time to reach the supermarkets. No one would spend such a long time to buy a bottle of drink. From the foregoing, a conclusion can be drawn that supermarkets don't mean super convenience, and I strongly suggest that more locl shops should be kept."

Cantonese,"Could anyone help me correct my writing , please ? Dear Peter , how are you , Peter ? i have arrived in Hong Kong . It is absolutely heart-warming to be back here after leaving for ages overseas , but i feel oddly strange about the place which has changed dramically in the course of time . I really want to tell you about this . Once i had stepped off the plane when it had arrived , i took a look around passionately under curiosity and enthusiasm . I found that the place has really changed and it is way different to the place i remebered . I remeber outside the airprot was planted with lines of trees and flowers and there was a park full of children' laughters , hawkers was making their businesses and most buildings were only a few levels high . Now they have all gone , the trees were hacked somehow , the flowers were killed by the smoke exhauted by cars , children are no longer playing in the park , i believe , they prefer staying at home playing computer games instead , the hawkers are forced to end their traditional businesses because of the restriction of the government and the buildings are just like completing their heights with each others . Sky-scrapers are bloking the sunshine that everyone has to walk under their shadows . I sighed how on earth could everything has changed so much quickly . I really miss the old place that i know full of trees and flowers , i miss the annoying shoutings of hawker which i found it harmonical now , and the scense of children having fun in the park , the old buildings which allow you see the whole view of the sky . Dispite of what i want , they are all gone and seem never going to be back , but who can help , this is inevitable under the development of one place and we can only accept it . So i am trying to get used to this . Now Hong Kong has become a really unique and prosperous place , it is quite a sight actually , i think you should visit Hong Kong sometime . Chris Wong"

Cantonese,"It's thankful to have a true friend A true friend makes me willing to spend my time for her. I feel regretless for scarifying my sleeping time. Today we revised our textbook, amazed by the lovely toys we had seen in IKEA, discussed about some deep topic that almost made me cried. We had a nice Sunday by getting along with each other naturally. It seems that our behaviors and emotions are just like an immature child. Nevertheless, I must say that it is hard to behave like a child again once we have grown up, needless to say finding a true friend who accepts your silly, childish behavior. So, I must repeat what I said in this entry's title, then say: thank you so much my dearest friend."

Cantonese,"The Hangover - movie of 2009 Recently, I have watched a comedy released in 2009 â€“ the Hangover. Dough, getting married in a few days, was having his Bachelor Party in Las Vegas with his 3 best friends. However, this went terribly wronglyâ€¦ Awakened in their hotel room, the three hung-over groomsmen found themselves with a big mess â€“ a leopard in the toilet, a missing tooth and an unknown baby. More importantly, the groom was missing, so as their memory! None remembered what happened the night before, so they needed to retrace their steps and discover what was happening. But time was running short, the wedding was coming up. Can they bring the groom back to Los Angeles for his wedding? Or the bride would be disappointed while her husband was found nowhere. If you have been to Las Vegas, you would find this movie familiar, as most of the movie is taken there. There is a reason why I like it. I like this movie also because it successfully puttogether elements that were unrelated and you can hardly predict how they got there. The groomsmen were like detectives who traced the case bit by bit with the limited evidence they have got. The dialogues are carefully thought which laughter is expected throughout the movie. If you like comedy-kind, I would strongly suggest this movie to you!"

Cantonese,"Recent homework Here's my public course homework ""Britpop Culture"", to analyse 1960s,1970s,1990s Britpop songs that about ""love"") (è¿™é‡Œæ˜¯æˆ‘å…¬é€‰è¯¾ç¨‹è‹±ä¼¦æ‘‡æ»šä¹æ–‡åŒ–çš„åŠŸè¯¾ï¼Œè¦åˆ†æž60ï¼Œ70ï¼Œ90å¹´ä»£è‹±ä¼¦æ‘‡æ»šä¸­å…³äºŽâ€œçˆ±â€çš„æ­Œæ›²) Love in three decades â€”â€”Britpop songs analysis Britpop is an important genre of popular music. As we know that rock music is a generic term for the range of styles that evolved out of rockâ€™nâ€™roll. In generally we can see the rockersâ€™ attitude and views to the society or the world. Along with the times changing and developing, the Britpop songs have different style character in different times. Today I would like to analyse three songs from the 1960s, 1970s and 1990s, which of these songs are all about love. In the 1960s Britpop songs, I choose Lady Jane ,which comes from The rolling stonesâ€™ first totally original album aftermath in 1966. The rolling stone is deeply impressed by the hippie movement ï¼Œalso the anti-tradition culture is popular in the 1960s. In this song the reader can easily feel the love from the â€œIâ€ to Lady Jane. The first sentence of the song is â€œMy sweet Lady Janeâ€, itâ€™s just like the front of a love letter, so sweet. â€œmy loveâ€ has appearanced many times through the whole song, the writer shows how he love Lady Jane everywhere, even we actually donâ€™t know who is Lady Jane, but we know that she is someoneâ€™s true love. The writer tells that heâ€™s Lady Janeâ€™s servant anytime, he give a troth to her, when he bends his knees , we get that heâ€™s poping the question to his lady. Itâ€™s a song that shows a man asking the lady to marry with him, it shows the pledge of the man, itâ€™s pure hearted and romantic. We are touched by this love atmosphere. The lyrics are simply, the love is expressed straightly, I have already enthralled by this song. The second song is Donâ€™t leave me now , comes from Pink Floyedâ€™, the album in 1979 ,the wall. Someone say that this album may be the most fantastic album in the world. This song is sad , itâ€™s full of the writerâ€™s puzzle dom. The writer is questioning and questioning, why his girlfriend will go away and how can she treat him in this way. Itâ€™s a heart broken guyâ€™s roar in evidence. The 1970s is Glam Rock â€˜s blooming time, the songs at this time is full of sensibility catharsis . In this age, many young people are concerning with how to express themselves better, you can even read the confusion of their thinking. This song can shows the people seeking for the answer between two peopleâ€™s love, why the result will goes in this way, why the love will evolve like this. It expresses the confusion and suffering of the loversâ€™ broken-up. In the 1990s, I found a song from one of the greatest Britpop band during this period. Itâ€™s Radioheadâ€™â€™s Creep. Creep is one of the favorite songs of Radioheadâ€™â€™s fans. Itâ€™s embodied in Radioheadâ€™â€™s first album Pablo Honey, which is terribly hit at that time. Itâ€™s a classical love song that make many audience listened in tears. This song is strongly filled with sorrow, anxiety and aspiration. The lyrics are straightly tells the writerâ€™s interior monologue, itâ€™s full of this poor manâ€™s impressments. â€œYou're so Fuck'n special, I wish I was special, but I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.â€ You can see the complex inner conflict from the writerâ€™s soliloquize, what a poor guy he is. I believe the lyrics here must arise many peopleâ€™s resonate. After doing the research of Britpop songs in different decades, I have come to realize more great Britpop bands and know more about the culture and social background behind these songs. Britpop is really great and worth listening, you must be fond of it after you making friends with it. PS: there may still have many mistakes in my homework, looking forword for your correction~ï¼ Thank you very much~!"

I just finished the grammar and vocabulary section of TEM4 paper tonight,but the surprised result really drove me nuts! It can't be true that I got nearly half my chosen answers wrong. Then I found that most of the answers were actually controversial after seeking help from my friends. It turned out to be that not all my answers were certainly incorrect. Afterwards,I've been trying to figure out the explanation for these errors one by one with the helping hands from some of my friends,the English native speakers. However,what's surprised to me most was that what they chose were exactly what I had thought was correct but which the so-called final correct answer said that I was wrong. :( you know,I believe that no one would rather trust the answers from the test creaters(å‡ºé¡Œäºº,all of them are Chinese even if propably many sentences were found out of the examples in a dictionary,)than the native speakers themselves. What do u think? Here I'm going to show you 2 questions from the test. Plz tell me which would be the best answer or the correct one. 1. Had Judy been more careful on the maths exam,she _____ much better results now. A. would be getting B. could have got (the so-called correct answer is A here,but what I had chosen was B,so was my friends) 2.

The colleague asked me some difficulties in her work and I gave some advices. I feel a sense of satisfaction as I think I could help her regardless of whether the advice work or not. Then I walked along Nathan Road alone and finally went to Science Museum. I have not been there for a long time. The facilities have no change at all but some are added in the museum to attract more visitor. I finally enjoy some facilities which I did not play last time. However, I feel lonely as no one was shared my happiness. Probably it is the right time for me to call some friends who do not contact for a long time."

I remembered the last time when I am asked what was the feeling toward my major, I surprised others as I said that at least I did like what I learn and what I choose to be. It's really surprising that a girl could love studying science. Especially, you know the trend of studying economics, management and business among today's Chinese undergraduates. But no matter how much I am determined, the process is hard and even torturing. Every exams week in the semester is always like the depressing darkness before the daybreak. And the tragedy is that you know, no matter how hard you try and work, the finals are still like impossible missions... I really wanna ask god for blessing and for help. But i also know well that God helps those who help themselves... T^T What can I do?~?"

It has been a year since I last went to a comic fair like that. I don't know many recently popular animations so I couldn't catch up what my cousin and her classmate talking about. Still I bought some little stuff like pins about Hetalia, which is still my favourite comic. It is about different countries, and even I don't have rich knowledge base about history, it gives me a lot of fun when seeing how the countries interact with each other. I return home with sore legs for walking around the fair for over 4 hours... Yet I consider today as a day of fun and I don't know how many days I could enjoy, sharing interests with acquaintances and leaving all things about the study all away.

Cantonese,"my essay ( about environment) 1 theme: Nowadays we are PRODUCING more and more rubish. Why do you think this is happening? What can goverments do you reduce the amont of rubish produce? As the overload increasing number of population and the rapidly development of industy nowadays , the ever-raising rubish become a nuising problem for the envirement and humankind. When it comes to why it happing and what can we do to due with the problem? Now let me discuss it in my essay. There are numerous contribute to the over-producing rubish , and the main reason comes from the exploding population . The exceeding large number of humanity,produce a great amont of rubish from their daily lifen,which is hard to control . What's more, the industries, growing in a incrediblely rapid speed ,in order to meet the overloading population,attribute to the exceeding pollution of our environment bacause of the solution to due with the pollutants,alway hardly meet the demand. And finally,some people, expecially some hosts of industries, are shot in a sense of environmental,who pursue the maximum profit only . All of those lead to all kinds of pollutions like air pollutions,water pollutions,and soil pollutions, what could not be agnore any more,because they are badly harm to our humanity health. What could we do to stop the boosting rubish produce? Of course,the goverment plays the most sinificant role. the first one and the most important one,in my opinion,is to enrise the sense of environmental to every citizents. Car-pooling,conserving water and electory used ,using environmental productions, and something like that,relates to our daily life. That seemse easy to do ,but contribute greatly to reduceing production of rubish. And also , the goverment should make a stringent laws to preserve our environment ,limiting the production of rubish,expecially facturies as well as punish seriously who violate the law.

Cantonese,"Need help with writing weekly... I have to write a summary of a news, but I really don't know how. A difficult time in Somalia, women need to work hard to provide basic needs for their family. They do almost everything to bring a living standard to their children, such as taking a job in Bakara market. Bakrana market is the biggest outdoor market in Somalia In the past, women in Bakara market used to sell tea or drinks. The situation has changed while more women are doing the jobs that are previously considered as menâ€™ job. Not only the widows(*1) take the menâ€™ jobs, the women whose husbands are still alive are also working because many men are unlike the women; they are not willing to do something for their children. The market is very risky because it is a fighting ground of the Islamic insurgent groups and the government force. There are many gun-shooting and killing; ironically, more and more women are working at there. Mohamud is one example among those working women. She has five children, but she has to leave them everyday. She needs to go to find a job at Bakara market; she has no other choice because she needs to feed her children. Some days, Mohamud can find a job for washing clothes; the other days, either a cleaning job or a guarding job. After working a day, she usually earns $1.5 USD. Despite she had lost many friends in the market, she decided to continue to take the risk because she can do almost everything for her children. the original article is this one http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/MYAI-7WU8YB?OpenDocument&RSS20=18-P"

Cantonese,"How do I understand a shopping space? How do I understand a shopping space? A wet market visit: understanding customer behavior For the first outing, we chose to do something unique. We decided that we would like to study the customer behavior in the wet market in Sham Shui Po. We stayed in the market to stay focused on its customer behavior. The sellers in the market have no flashy advertisements, but they have a raw slogan banner. That said, the message is easier to understand. The display of the goods is not well-organized, but customers are enjoying shopping in the wet market and searching for real bargains. This is because of 2 factors; one is the collective shopping experience and the other is the cheaper price of the products. Festival wall visit: understanding how a modern shopping spaces operate For the second shopping mall outing, we need to go to Festival walk to observe its operations. I can see that the layout plan of festival walk is very humanized. The wide shopping corridor, the high ceiling, and the wise setting of the escalator enhance the customers comfortable experience. Also, the standardized shop font, glass walls, and clear separation of zoning gives the feeling of liveliness and brightness. The signs, graphics, and patterns are also very uniform to avoid customer confusion. What have I learned in shopping spaces lessons? Lessons of shopping spaces allow us to know more about the story behind operating a retail shop or shopping mall. From the design of master planning and layout and interior design to the marketing strategy are those involved. Besides that, I know that a successful shopping space should also create a shopping experience, like applying the five senses to the design. About the design master planning: we need to think about the customer flow (circulation), flow of goods (logistic) and the basic restriction of the building needs. In one of our workshop, we need to organize a 10metres x 10metres shopping space. We need to focus on not only generating the shopping experience, but also making good use of the space itself. If we only focus on how to create a good shopping experice, it will finally come down to the problem of not obeying the building laws. I understand that there are restrictions before I do a project and design. Moreover, there is sharing of brandy (shopping mall designer), supplier, and horace (experienced retail shop designer). Their sharing gives us a closer tough to the real design business. As design students, we do need to explore the real world of design as soon as possible. Those meet in the real world: the importance of material chosen, the restrictions and the marketing strategy. How do I apply lessons learned in our design? As we come to the final stage, we need to revolutionize a product and make use of what we have learned in the previous lessons. We chose a nostalgic game, airplane chess. We would like to revolutionize the game to a more recreational game. We study other similar gamesâ€™ successful factors and then try to merge them into our own design. Based on what we have learned in previous lessons, we tried to first set our target user and analyze the factors to increase the interest of playing the game. We think the game should be something about promoting the joy of sharing among the family. We also think of promoting strategies, like the brand cooperation and band extension that was learned in the previous lessons."

Cantonese,"by the canal Birds were serenading. The early-evening sun was warming the canal. And by the canal, laughter from my friends was heard regularly. Among them, one was exceptionally happy. She who nobody understands. She who is always surrounded by many friends-guys and girls-and many god-sisters and god-brother. Jealous or envy, one could say, but there was definitely anger and unhappiness in me. She who had once my girlfriend has chosen to do lots. She has chosen to do things that even though she herself knows that by doing those will hurt me. What you want to achieve?? To hurt me and to make me forget you? Or to try to draw the line between us. Jealousy, something that once seemed distant to me. Something that I thought I would never experience it, other than towards peoples who I detest to the core. Being angry to the girl I love ,too, seemed impossible to me. Unpleased unhappiness anger jealousy....... was a total contrast of love or were they just a part of it? Problems beset us after that day. Problems that were started by us. Problems that you are unwilling to speak up, refused-for whatever reasons you have-to tell me. I may not able to solve those problems, but you have to let me try to solve it. Don't bottle up all your feeling. Tell me and we will solve all these together.

Polish,"A minute before alarm clock. It happened 2 days ago early in the morning. I was suddenly awake, and my first thought was that I was late for work. I looked at a TV clock to check what time it was but the digits were a blur. It was partly because I had just awakened and partly because I can't see clearly without my glasses. So I hastily started looking for my mobile which I usually use as alarm clock. I thought I had turned it off unconsciously and that now it was somewhere in a bedding. In a hurry I checked under the pillows, under the duvet, on the floor around the bed, but the mobile was nowhere to be seen. I stood up and only then noticed that my mobile was lying on a chair. I had deliberately put it there so I had to stand up to turn it off instead of turning it into a ""nap"" mode. I checked what time it was. It was 5.59 am, a minute before an alarm clock would go off."

Polish,"Book's review If you could correct this text, I'll be very thankful :) This is my book's review. The last book Iâ€™ve read was â€˜Crime and punishmentâ€™ written by Fiodor Dostojewski. At first, I did not want to read it, because it is prescribed reading (and I think prescribed readings are boring), after all Iâ€™ve decided to read it. Furthermore, this book has interested me! The story takes place in Petersburg, big city in Russia, in 1866. The main character called Raskolnikow is an ex-student of the law. One day he decides to kill an old usurer who cheates poor students. He thinks, if he kill her, heâ€™ll prevent yourself that heâ€™s extraordinary person and he would change the world. After murder, he wants to get back his normal life, but he jumps to conclusion he canâ€™t, because thinking of murder plagues him. He donâ€™t want to meet with his family who he hasnâ€™t seen from years, he donâ€™t want to do something, all his life is thinking about murder. He canâ€™t deal with fact he is a killer. In the end, he falls in love with prostitute and decides to plead guilty. He is exiled to Syberia, to hard work. When heâ€™s working, he jumps to conclusion he has to change his life â€“ he deals with murder and he want to start all over again. This is psychological book. In my opinion, itâ€™s a bit long book who tells about humanâ€™s psychic and prevents us somebody can be a killer."

Polish,"How do I learn English? I thought it would be a nice idea to write how do I actually learn English, so you can use my method, too. How am I immersed into English? Usually, for as much time as I can, I am trying to surround myself with English. It can be everything: podcasts, something to read (books, articles etc.), movies, even music or something else. It's important for me to always have something to learn English from. But do I understand everything from these podcasts and books and other things? Of course not. When I don't know some word and I'm not at home, I check it in dictionary and put it onto regular paper-wordlist. When I'm back at home I put all of words from the wordlist into a program called Anki. If I'm learning at home, I put new words with their translations directly into Anki (paper-wordlist isn't required then). Sometimes I write something on this site (like today). The most important factor in my English learning is fun. If learning gives me no fun and it's boring, there must be something wrong with it. I think it's enough for today - this post is getting too long. Maybe I'll write a second part of this entry. You can use my method also for other languages, not only for English. If you have some questions about this learning method, don't be shy and scared. Just ask me them in comments. Until next time!"

Polish,"English entry 13 Long Time no entry, right? What do like more manga or anime? I like anime more, because I can't read manga. I don't mean my Japanese language abilities, I meant that I don't understand what's going on xD. It's pretty sad. For example I don't know how one of manga ended because I didn't understand 3 last shot's (I men this part of page in Comics) Understanding anime is easier, and I can even watch it in Japanese version, I can't do that with manga. Hmm why I don't understand Japanese comics , mostly because , onomatopoeias xD, in Manga drawings don't move , and this little katakana words say what person is doing, (Crying running etc.) some drawings are unclear or can mean two or more things. Any way reading manga for me even in English version is hard xD. Anime also have weak points, but I still prefer anime than manga . BTW. Do you have some Manga/anime recommendations for me? Please share."

Polish,"pliss help :) I have a huge request for assistance in improving this work which I need for class. I would be very grateful. Our tour starts with the city of Wroclaw in dolny Å›lÄ…sk, located on the Odra River. Very nice place to rest, both tourists and inhabitants of Wroclaw is the Japanese Garden in Wroclaw. Suitable terrain, oriental symbolism, interesting plant compositions, a small waterfall, a pond with a bridge and many others enjoy the eye a break from reality here and feel the beauty of nature amidst the big city. Walking around Wroclaw, you may notice a small cast metal dwarfs. They are located in various places in most of the old town and show different situations, people and ideas. Their purpose is to promote Wroclaw. Children and adults but also have fun in Wroclaw Zoo. You can spend 3-4 hours and the best way to do during the nice weather. Many specimens are naturally in a confined space but most of the best looks on the catwalks. The zoo also will find a place where you can eat ice cream, casserole, and buy refreshments. On the street Jatki, whose history dates back to the Middle Ages is a monument in honor of animals for slaughter. In addition, along the narrow streets are arranged in numerous craft galleries. It is a charming place to visit. On the street Åšwidnicka held a big chunk of the old town there are sculptures of people supposedly coming out of the basement. It is a symbol of the underground struggle against communism and the revival in the era of Solidarity. Known Hansel and Gretel houses in the Market Square in Wroclaw attracts many tourists. Market Wroclaw is a place most charming - full of sights, attractions and cultural events. If you are tired you can come here to rest.

Polish,"AIESEC CHINA QUESTIONAIR It's important for me, so I'd really appreciate if someone could check it. Why do you apply for Explore China? What do you want to get it from? What is your expectation of it? For 3 year I'm interested into Asian culture, especially Chinese, Korean & Japanese. It all started with pop-culture like music, film and dramas. Now I'm studying Japanese Studies, but during them I've realised how big Chinese influences are in these countries. Because of that, I'd like to get to know better China, make Chinese friends and experience their daily life. I hope to be able to look at the world from perspective of Chinese even just a little. I'm also willing to create a bond between Poland and China, share my passion with people in my country! And if it's possible learn some chinese for better understanding and communication. Please suggest your attractiveness for you to be chosen as Explore China EP based on your strength and weakness. I can easly addapt to new places, don't have a problem about staying with new people and working with them. I'm always trying to solve problems by calm talk, people just need to learn listen to each others. I have some experience in organising educational events and workshops for kids. I was also sometimes helping with english my friend's siblings so I know how it looks, but I'm not afraid of trying new things! I must admit that is a little bit hard for me to talk about myself, I know that I may be lacking in some things but I really want to do my best! What kind of material can you prepare for showing the culture of your country in a global village? Beside of standard historical & geography facts I can bring some photos or videos about life in Poland. Prepare some popular music and movies, because I think that it's more interesting to show something rather than only talking. I can also cook some polish traditional dishes or bring some sweets for example. What kind of cultural acctivities can you organize in a community? I'm pretty good at drawing, making cutouts and similar kind of stuff. I was thinking about preparing workshops with for explame making polish cut outs. Polish pavilion at Expo in Shanghai was all covered with them so it could be interesting. I can also organize english classes or some activities including singing, integration games. How much do you know about Chinese culture, especially Cantonese Culture? I'm trying to keep track of current issues in China, I'm reading books about Chinese culture and about China-Japan relations (that's because of my studies). So I'm not a totall newbie when it comes to talk aboutI culture, but nothing can replace visit to China. Don't know so much about Cantonese Culture, but I started reading about it & about Cantonese language recently. You need to organize to show what Chinese culture is like in your own eyes and appealing for culture protection. What's the workshop, which organized by you, would be like? Can't yet visualise how would look whole workshop, because I don't know what exacly my impression will be, but I'd like to organize interesting workshop, interact with people, say something about what I was thinking about China before visit, what where my expectations and how it really was. I want to talk how foreginers think about Chinese culture and what we can learn from it. What will you do if the audiences of the workshop know just a little English? I'd prepare some plan B, like earlier made presentation with Chinese subtitles, or flayers with main topics of workshops written in Chinese. I can also ask for a help from someone who knows Chinese and in exchange later help that person in his/hers duties. Are you good at art, singing, dancing etc.? I'm pretty good at drawing and art, I like to sing and I'm not shy to do it, but my voice isn't extraordinary. I was dancing 1,5 year ballroom dance and then 2 years some hip-hop, but it was long ago. What do you think if you need to do a lot of preparation before you arrive? It's not a problem at all. I know that I still have many thing to learn ant it's a part of my self improvement. :)"

Polish,"Past Simple Hey It's going to be my first serious post here so here it is. I'd like to share with you about my English tenses concerns. I've been trying to understand the concept of tenses for a long time and I'm still getting confused which one to use, especially when talking about past. I find it hard to explain to myself all implications that tenses have and remeber it so I can use them correctly. For example: I read in a newspaper that English is simple. I've read in a newspaper that English is simple. Is using past simple when no talking about specific time in the past wrong? I don't see any difference between these two senteces, for me they have the same meaning. But I wonder if maybe using specific tense implies something more than that ""English is simple"" and I'm not aware of it..."

Polish,"Authority - Homework. Lots of people has a owns authority. They need to someone, who they can admire and imitate. Itâ€™s not bad, but I havenâ€™t someone like this. Maybe one day Iâ€™ll find, but I donâ€™t think so. And there appear a question : Why? The answers is easy. In my opinion people should lead owns lives itself. In most case is very important own sentence, without that we are only puppets. For some independet thinking is very difficult, but it doesnâ€™t mean, that they cannot try. Now I think about extreme cases. Direction of my life I choose alone. Iâ€™ll live with consequences my choice, no someone other. Itâ€™s another reasen, that I donâ€™t have a authority.

Polish,"Boxing and martial arts I think boxing as well as many other martial arts don't rate among to brutal sports. They are kind of sports while two players are fighting each other at organized matches. There are many people who the spectacle such that must be very gratifying and it's an interesting type of entertainment for them. The players do these sports to control theirs outbursts and self-defenses, function of organisms and reduce a level of fear. In the event of any injuries at these matches there is a medical attention. Furthemore each of players on the battle wear protective headgear, knockdowns and knockouts. In my opinion this is a good kind of sport and it haven't to be forbidden."
Polish,"My interests;) I have a lot of interests, so I have no time to develop them. When I'm developing one of them, that forget about other.

My parents at the beginning not wanted agree, but now likes them. I know that the most people afraid of the spiders, but the most fowlers are mild and interesting to observe. My second interest is a sport. I like jogging, martial arts, and above all le parkour. Unfortunately, I have no time to seriously it train. From time to time I run and trains at a boxing bag, and nothing more. My next interest is paleontology. I liked always dinosaurs ald other extinct animals. I also like Japan and I try learn Japanese. Japanese is not hard, but I need a lot of practice writing. Unfortunately, I spend too little time to it. I have a talent, I can draw well. By the talent I have all the time contract drawings from friends. It absorbs time, but what not to do for friends?:P"

Polish,"postcard Dear Ola We are in France now, actual in Marseille. We are staing here to next Friday. The weather is amazing, its sunny, really hot and the water in the sea is wonderful. The sea is full of octopuses , jelly fishes and maritime living animals. Also our hotel is fantastic, we have really exlusive and pretty apartment with the most beautiful seaview which i have ever seen. But in spite of that all, we have horrible time. You can imagine how horrible it is that we dont really care about this all great things. First of all workers of the French airport lost our dog!After flight we wanted to take away our luggage and Amol ... but we got only luggage. They have sent our dog to different continent!Amol is propably in China! Second thing is really bad organisation of local transport. They write in their leaflets that the bus is left from the hotel to city for free every day. Yeah, its true. But the bus is going there for 5 hours. ( and the distance between hotel and city is only 30km. ) Another ''small'' minus of this holiday is food. You know that we dont like sea food so i was really happy when i red in their leaflet that they had ,, delicious food for everyone''. Unfortunately they dont , they serve only seafood. And last thing but the most annoing is stupid french people. They are so rude, they are propably think that they are the best in everything in entire world, and they treat tourists like worse people. They forgot that we are paying them, we give them a job!"
Polish,"Story - ""An accident"" It was dull Wednesday. I felt tired because I hadn't slept much at night. I was bumbled all day. The coming happenings convinced me that it had been the worst day of my life. I came back home from school with a bad mark. Exasperation made resting and going to bed my priority. I took a shower and put on a yellow shirt. It became dump but I wasn't fussing over it. I strolled to the kitchen and went up to the kettle. I had to plug it in but my hands were also a bit wet. As I was around to do it I stopped myself and after a moment though ""Nothing bad is gonna to happen."" I should have wiped my hands on anything but I didn't. It was the most dumb thing I have ever done. When I touched the socket the kettle burnt down. I had an electric shock. My whole body was shaving and I started screaming and moaning with pain. My mother fast run up to me. My eyes glisted with tears. She called an ambulance. The doctor and so my mum helped me. I was taken to hospital to be treated. Fortunately, nothing terrible with my health happened. I have never touched a socket with wet hands again."

Polish,"Ethics of war Could you check it for me?:) It's first part of composition about ethics of war. I don't agree with this view but I have to write about it:( :) People have been fighting each other since prehistoric times, and we have been discussing the rights and wrongs of it as long as we live. So we would like to talk to you about the ethics of war, because we think that topic of rightness of war isnâ€™t clear. Of course, most people say that war is one of the greatest tragedies and we shouldnâ€™t militate. But in the other hand, itâ€™s fact that after the end of Second World War , armed conflict didn't cease. Somebody calculated that after 1945 there were about 2.500 (two thousand five hundred) conflicts in the world. They was civil wars* and interstate wars**. So, one of the parts which we want to talk about is realism in international relations. Itâ€™s opinion that national interests are the most important and war isnâ€™t bad if it defend our business. Realists believe that war is an inevitable part of an anarchical world system. They are very skeptical in matter of morality. They think that ethics hasn't nothing to do with the world of global politics, where only the strong can survive. War is good solution if something threaten our stability, independence etc. Wars are in places, where people are not able to resolve conflicts in a peaceful way. In other words, the war may be necessity. Morality during the war is completely different from morality during peace. So we could conclude that soldiers can kills enemies of their country and such actions are fully justified. If rules of international law, hinders a wartime, soldiers should disregard them. If war has begun, state should do whatever it can to win."

Polish,"Chocolate lover I love chocolate. Unfortunately, it makes me fat and I have to confine myself to eating it. That doesnâ€™t mean I can live without chocolate. I canâ€™t. Life without chocolate is boring. Since Iâ€™m not allowed to eat chocolate I had to find something else, that could make me happy. Thereâ€™s a solution: chocolate milk! Itâ€™s not as fattening as bar of chocolate and tastes great! I only drink one cup of chocolate milk per day, but it helps me to say away from sweets. You can also find a little bit of chocolate in my bathroom. I had a gel douche, that smelled like white chocolate and honey (thatâ€™s what producer says, I canâ€™t agree with that one). Last month my brother bought me a bath gel with cute cow on the packing. It smells amazing! Sweet chocolate, yummy! Iâ€™m a perfumholic, so I tried to find anything that smells like chocolate (and doesnâ€™t make me feel sick). My choice was, of course, Angel by Thierry Mugler. Chocolate is one of the fragrance notes and I donâ€™t have headaches after using this. I like this fragrance, it reminds me of sweets, but my mom says, I smell like flowers on graveâ€¦ Thatâ€™s ok, I donâ€™t care. Today I used it up, and since I donâ€™t have any money left to spend it on perfumes, I need to take a little break from using it. Good news about chocolate fragrances: I also have Angel Sunessence Bleu Lagon. The fragrance doesnâ€™t remind of original version, but it turns me on! Chocolate in the fragrance notes is almost imperceptible. Since I also love lipsticks and lip glosses (wait, havenâ€™t I say, Iâ€™m a shopaholic?), I had to buy something chocolate-a-like. Itâ€™s hard to find anything, thatâ€™s brown and looks good on my lips, because Iâ€™m very pale. Iâ€™ve made some mistakes, but finally I bought a lipstick and four lip glosses, that donâ€™t make me look like an idiot. (Sorry for all mistakes, my grammar sucks)"

Polish,"Why do you think people attend college or university? There may be many various reasons why people decide to continue their education after high school. In my opinion there isnâ€™t only one reason that is decisive, and the decision is influenced by different factors. Everyone wants to have a well paid job, in which one can develop and derive satisfaction from. Having a master degree in a certain field can significantly enhance your opportunities in getting a job you want. University is also a great place to increase knowledge in subjects of your interest. University is a good learning environment, where you have tutors and other students to help you when you need it. It may be both motivating and beneficial. But attending university isnâ€™t only about reading books and cramming before exams. They say that itâ€™s the most beautiful time in your life. Prospect of constant parties, concerts and other social occasions appeals to many young people as much as a career to others."
Polish,"English entry 18 Do you like mims? According to Wiki [A mime artist is someone who uses mime as a theatrical medium or as a performance art, involving the acting out a story through body motions, without use of speech. In earlier times, in English, such a performer was referred to as a mummer. Miming is to be distinguished from silent comedy, in which the artist is a seamless character in a film or sketch. ] Mostly it's a person who acts without voice. My favourite mime is Polish Ireneusz Krosny. Mime comedian. He is one of the best, he got a lot of awards for mimes and comedians. the best thing in mimes is that , that anyone can understand it , not matter what age, religion, or language does person uses. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaAGFOkj3aM Matura= Polish exam for adult (In High school ) VERY IMPORTANT I also like musician comedians, some of gags are also understand , some not. My favourite is Polish group ""Grupa MoCarta"" (Group of Mozart) Unfortunately to most of gags you have to be familiar with old Polish music ;( . One of my favourites is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrlYy8i0G3Y (Desks for notes) Nice watching !( You can find other performances by looking at Related videos) Do you know some comedians like that. (Generally not verbal? ) Coz I don't understand English comedians .. :("
Polish,"It's only a winter. Sometimes, in eighteen year old girl's life, it comes the day, when your contact lenses don't match to your eyes. When all your plans lose out with deficiency of motivation. When each friend of yours has his own business, which is not a meeting with you. When empty bowl after your pudding is laying on your desk and you don't take this to the kitchen, beacuse you're so lazy. When you even don't know what exactly song you want to listen! Yes. Today is that day in my life. A debut. First adult depression. It's strange, but it feels just like previous ones. I still have been complaing about my weight and myself. I don't want to talk with anyone. It's depression like some others. Nothing new. I've had the tricks for days like that day. I used to go for a lonely walk, wear a dress (self esteem, you know...), get my big red bag and... I was just going. Across Lucjan Rydel's street, to the Bronowice, till Armia Krajowa's Avenue. There was a bright, shinning sun above my head and breeze around. All bad things have gone. But now? Now it's a -18 Centigrades. It means: WINTER. If I went for a walk, probably I would die! But it's only winter... Relax... Few weeks... And I'll see flowers, leaves and sandals! Depression doesn't wear shoes like these ones. It will be SPRING. Soon. (I don't care about all these mistakes right now, but I'm sure, there are a lot.)"
Polish,"Dear Diary. It's end of my 'winter break'. Tommorow I have to wake up about 4 hours earlier than today. Last 2 weeks I was at home, so I was sleeping as long as I wanted. It was nice time at all. I did more than 100 maths exercises. Also I've started revising (and expanding) my English vocabulary (take a look at one of my word lists http://wd2.photoblog.pl/np1/201102/3A/86551811.jpg ) Valentine's Day is tomorrow. Actually, I think I don't like this day. I'm sure it's a big part of American culture and tradition, but in Poland... Not really. In my opinion, it's just another good possibility to sell stupid things. There are too many pathetic hearts or pink things in shops. Sure, some of these 'things' are good, but most of them are tacky and tasteless. You may think that I'm jealous, because I'm single. But hey, even when I'm in love, I still think that pink hearts with 'I love you' all over it are not cool :) Even though I don't like commercial meaning of this day, I'm going to make some drawings for my best friends and give them some chocolate tomorrow. But I'm doing it quite often, not only on that day."
Polish,":) Further findings of Bak (2009: 46) present that 94,7% of the respondents does not participate in activities in their close surroundings. Asked the question whenever the respondents participate in the activities for the goodwill of the municipality, 93,8% of the respondents answered that they do not. Asked if they feel that the local authorities are reliable in solving issues within the community, the majority of the citizens agreed that they are. It means that the problem-solving mechanism in Bielsko-BiaÅ‚a has developed its own characteristic way. Another alternative for the lack of civic engagement in Bielsko-BiaÅ‚a might be the role of enterprise. It might be claimed that the collective action problems are solved by enterprise. This form offers a solution to social problems, and the individuals are immediately rewarded for their contribution. This explains the dynamics of the society in Bielsko-BiaÅ‚a. Bearing in mind that the enterprise replaced the need for civic engagement, the citizens in Bielsko-BiaÅ‚a created their own alternative to the collection action. The civic engagement of the citizens in Bielsko-BiaÅ‚a is low, while the performance of the town institutions is rated as high. The satisfaction of citizens of this performance is also reasonable. It means that the town and its citizens have found their own specific way of dealing with the problems of collective action. Presented in the analysis data shows that citizens find solving collection action problems a task of the responsible officials. The satisfaction from the institutional performance is high, which possibly causes the passive position of the community in solving social problems."

Polish,"hey! Youâ€™ve took my pen with you! Last week I participated in a workshop on Deaf culture and sign language. The workshop was held by two great trainers. They had very good materials which facilitates learning. Among others they had short movies with scenes performed by the trainers. One of those movies was with a small error. After the scene an cameraman didnâ€™t switch off a camera and we could watch a few sign not being a part of scene (which was: a student coming to university office). In a first moment the trainer was ashamed, so we was thinking that she signed in the movie something not very nice. She understood that and she immediately decided to join this â€œillegalâ€ part to whole exercise. So we also learned this last signs. Thanks to that I will remember to end of my life how to sign: â€œhey! Youâ€™ve took my pen with you!â€."

Polish,"A nightmare journey Last summer me and three of my friends decided to go to WrocÅ‚aw to film festival. Even though we were supprised by the fact that weather spoiled a minute when we reached our destination - and from the beggining of summer vacations to this moment on every day was sweltering, we were still in good mood. WrocÅ‚aw these time was a vibrant city. Four of us watched 3 films a day, eatting out somewhere in a city and then gather together in the late evening. When the end of our staying approached, me and my friend Sonia decided to go from WrocÅ‚aw straight to another destination instead of returning home â€“ she chose Hel and I chose BiaÅ‚ystok We checked train schedule and it turned out that both trains start off about 5 a.m.A little discouraged, but desperated to extend our vacations without parents, we went to bed early. After a couple hours of sleeping, I woke up (my train set off a leattle earlier then hers) and like a lunatic I washed, grabbed a suitcase and ordered a taxi. When I reached a station, the train was already there. I entered it and as we were setting off, I asked a chunky man to put my suitcase in a hutch. And then I became stunned. I realized that I accidentally took Sonia's suitcase because they were similiar in a dark. She rang me a few minutes later and confirmed my mistake. We had no choice, and we accepted this accidental switch. However, a stay without my stuff wasn't so great even though I borrowed a few things from a friend of mine in BiaÅ‚ystok."
Polish,Another day with English Hi As I said few weeks ago I bought Amazon Kindle. I am even pleased with this device than before. Yesterday I had to sit in a car for twelve hours. I had a Kindle with me. I ended reading one book and simply bought new one. It is really the best way to buy I have ever seen. One simple click and I have a book on my Kindle. I read users reviews first of course before buying. Everything on my Kindle (3G version). Thank you for correction.

Polish,"About my car :) It's very hard think of the topic on which can write on Lang-8. Some topics I reject subconsciously because I think they are too hard (to write on my level of knowledge:)) Other because they don't have any sense (they are meaningless). I should consider about any thematic series. Today I'll try to tell you about my car :) I receive it from my parents because they change car for new one. I have a car powered by gas (not gasoline but autogas - LPG). Car powered in this way is much cheaper in keeping. In Poland it's very popular way of replacing petrol, cheaper substitute. Recently, after refueling my car didn't want to start. I really don't know why. It's quite old (it has twelve years) and I know because of that it is a much bigger probability it break down in the most unsuitable moment. Fortunately, autogas isn't the only one way of powering in this car. Autogas works like ""overlay"" on petrol, so the only thing I had to do is switch it off. After few hours everything back to normal (without any help and fix). It's a charm of old cars :)"
Polish,"Hello, first post:) Hi everyone. So, this is my first post on this page. I must admit, im not convinced that anyone would answer me, but still i want to try. I would like to write a little bit about my english. First of all, i don't have occasion to talk in english. I try to read books or watch movies but i can't talk back or speak to someone and therefore i lack a lot of words. Then, second, often i use word or sentences i've heard in movies or games and i'm not pretty sure i could use them in common talk. You can, my english is rather poor and very, i've missed this word and i don't want to check it in translator:), stiff? Not flexible. I think, it's enought for a first post, thank You for reading this post and i'm looking forward to any answer. Cheers:)"
Polish,"First post ever So, since this is my first post, I want to ask you all (whoever is reading this) to point out every mistake I make. Something that might interest you (yeah, right :P): my stepfather's grandma came over today. The most amazing fact is that she's 91 years old! Can you imagine? She doesn't have alzheimers or anything, you can talk with her, she's able to do a lot of things despite her age. She only has some major problems with walking, but her mind is as young as mine, I think. So anyway, I hope I'll stay here at Lang-8 for a little while and maybe make some friends, who knows. See you around!"
Polish,"bored This is such a boring day. I woke up to early and it already made me upset. Later I have few appointments and few errands to run which I suppose to start already but I can't force myself to do it. Lack of motivation and focus always was my issue. I just registered to Lang 8 with hope that at least I can finally improve my writing in English. I've done IELTS in the past and my results were pretty good however my writing always was a disaster, I manage to achieve only 5.5 from writing! If you will compare that to 8.5 from reading, 6.5 from speaking and 8.0 from listening then it shouldn't be for you a surprise that I'm dissatisfied with that kind of result. At first to improve my writing I started to read more, and I'm not talking about film subtitles anymore. I started to read books and articles, I realize that my reading was pretty good however I started to read not only passively but I mainly focused now how it is written. I really believe that this will improve my writing finally if I will constantly try to do it and add using lang8 with it on regular basis. I really had no subject prepared for today, so as my start here I wrote about my previous experiences about writing in English and how I hate mornings. At afternoon my writing would be probably much more optimistic. Anyway I hope someone will check and correct it, plus that I will get some advice on which aspects of my writing should I focus.

Polish,"Hello Hello, I have just returned from the DÄ…bki resort. I was there for 2 weeks. It was really relaxing and interesting time. During that holiday period I have completely forgot about the reality... Kama- you have asked me to make descriptions of books that were mentioned on my blog before. It is not easy , but I will try: â€œThe Idiotâ€ tells a story of the prince who returned to Russia after the medical treatment taken in Switzerland ( he suffers from an epilepsy) . Despite a good and simple way of living he faces many misunderstandings and suffers much in his native country. â€œThe story of a soulâ€ is an autobiography written by the Carmelite nun who is better known as a little flower. â€œRozmowy z katemâ€ is a sort of interview conducted by an Home Army`s officer. The interviewed person was J. Stroop â€“ the general of an german army. They have met each other in the prison in Warsaw just few months after the second World War.

Polish,"English entry 16 http://www.snapvine.com/bp/W5adhhr0Ed6HUAAwSFxx0g Today I was in library, to lend some books written in english, unfortuneatly they was only about 9 books in English and I chose 'Star of the Sea' written by Joseph O'connor. It has about 400 pages, so I think I will menage this in a month. I lend this book because I need to learn some vocabulary and try written language, which is different and much harder that for example while we are talking. In my opinion learning vocabulary from books is excellent , because 1. We learn vocabulary with a context. 2. We learn a lot of synonyms. 3. We learn how to understand the sentence without knowing a word of two in a sentence. 4. It's so fun . I usually don't read books, but If I had to I would read it in foreign language xD. (Two bird with one stone) I know that reading normal books (I don't mean this books for English learners that has 1000 vocabulary, are boring and short) will be hard for me at the beginning but I hope that after two or 3 books it will become easier and easier!. What do you think? Is this method really works?"
Polish,Unforgettable business trip It was two month ago. I travelled by car with my associate to a neighbouring town. When we arrived we noticed that we are not in the right place. We were wondering for a moment. We had no enough time to turn back. The meeting was to start in 10 minutes. We called to boss. He was angry with us but he postponed the meeting. My associate noticed a policeman. We asked him in with direction we should go. He showed us a right direction. This building was as the next bend.

But a few years later, when the young lovers meet, there is no force that can separate them... I highly recommend this movie! :)"

Tomasz has been a joy to have in class. He is an independent, self directed person who is able to communicate effectively and meet even the most demanding challenges. While in my class, he was always respectful and diligent student. Tomasz is representative character with highly dedicated in improving his efficiency. His Chinese improves really quickly what is shown by his good grades. Moreover, Tomasz is strongly interested in Chinese culture, what proves his Dissertation topic which is â€œChinese mythologyâ€. I can fully recommend him to this scholarship as a good, well prepared student and an interesting person."

Polish,"Let's talk about King Arthur Today will be about legend's of King Arthur and his knights. Since I have seen ""Merlin"" on BBC I'm fascinated in this topic. I know that this story is a little naive (I mean BBC serial), but I like it mostly for wonderful music, costums (Morganas dresses are extraordinarily) and pictures. I won't forget a scene from first (or second?) season when Morgana in purple coat, looking like a Little Red Riding Hood for adult, was walking across winter forest and been attacked by scorpions (or what else was it). In was almost plastic, just like a painting. Well, that was some time ago. Now, I try to learn something more about Arthurian legends. Actually I have been reading ""The Mists of Avalon"" by M. Z. Bradly in english. I quite enjoy it. The story is concentrated mostly on women, Morgaine, Igreine, Viviane and Gvenhwyfar. I don't like the last one, she seems childish and pretentious. Strong advantage of the book is authors orginal point of wiev on ""old religion"" involving Great Goddess, magic etc. and her dissapointment on Christians who doesn't understand that ""All gods ale one God"". By the way, I would be very happy, if you could recommend me some good books which are more concentrated on Arthur and history of Albion."

Polish,"censorship in Poland Probably not much of you know that after collapse of communism, in polish television we still have a censorship. I've started this post in a bit controversial way to gather your attention. To be honest there is no blue pencil as it was in times of communism, but i want to tell you about thing on polish TV that is really annoying me and, in my consideration, is totally hypocritical. I'm talking about censorship of swearing in foreign movies translated for polish TV. Maybe you don't know, but in polish language there is loads of ways of insulting someone or speaking in rude way. When it comes to swearing, polish language is much richer than english. You can use words like kurwa (whore), chuj (dick) and pierdolic(to fuck) in so many ways and meanings (both, positive and negative). And to be honest majority of Poles uses those words without any hesitation in everyday conversations. In most of polish tv stations, foreign movies are aired with lecturer reading polish translation. But in every station they are censoring the screenplay by replacing swears with some polite equivalents. Maybe it is fun for first few times to hear criminals in movies like scarface or dangerous minds talking like kids in kindergarten, but in general, in my humble opinion it is rather pathetic and indicates that tv stations treat grownup viewer like a retard. Btw. polish movies are not censored this way and you can hear loud ""Kurwa mac!""."

Polish,"Rewiev of a book Cleverly and skilfully written, Dan Brown's first novel, Digital Fortress is regerded as one of the best techno-thriller novel ever written. The story is set in United States and the plot centres on human right of correspondence privacy with National Security Agency in the background. The action starts when the United States National Security Agency's code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious and ingeniously complex code called Digital Fortress that it can not break. The agency calls in Susan Fletcher, a brilliant mathematician and their head cryptographer, to crack it. She realized that the code is a viral program designed to break down NSA's head computer and discovers that it was written by Ensei Tankado, a former NSA employee who became displeased with intrusion into people's private lives. The NSA find themselves in a position of needing to intercept and destroy the algorithm before it can be released to the world and render their spying efforts useless. One of the things i like the best is the breath-taking plot which will hold the attention of reading every page. Book is full of unexpcted twists of action and we do not know who is truly the terrorist and who is actually freedom`s guardian. My only criticism of the book is that the novel has a lot of chapters and you need a lot of patience to read it but Digital Fortress is surely worth your time. All in all, if you are a fan of thrilles you will love this book. And if you are not I would still recommend it because Digitall Fortress contains amazing story which let you drag away from grey reality and certainly change your opinion about thrilling books."

On my street was old house, and two people live in this house. Old marriage. The husband have maybe 80 year's old, and wife was little bit younger. Some day when sun was rising hard, and everywhere was still snow after long winter, this gaffer come to our house and knock.

Polish,"Translation of random political article. - Is it already 67 years? - my mother ask me hearing information about Warsaw Uprising in TVN. I remember like it was yesterday. She never wonder about uprising's point, although she lost then a lot of friends. During military conflict between German's army she was helping wounded in Veterinary Institute in Praha, when was the hospital. Fighting spirit for independent was so strong that nobody disagreed with people living in Warsaw. Father who was locked in German's camp thought about it extremely different. He had no doubt that it was unneeded waste of people's lives. After message about uprising came to camp everybody there was depressed. Price of unsuccesfull trial retrieving independent was very controversial â€“ about 10.000 killed, 7.000 lost, 5.000 seriously injured, 150.000 â€“ 200.000 civilians dead."

Polish,"Rewiew Tomorrow for my English class I am going to write a review. I will try to write something similar to look for common mistakes I can make in such writing Topic: (Em ... Think about some topic. Think! ) Book from childhood that impressed you the most and why ? (How is that ? ;) ) When I first read this book, I could not go through like more of the half, but when ""The Sacred Garden"", became my obligatory book , and I had to read it, it was so compelling that I devoured it extremely fast. Book written by Frances Hodgson Burnett, is absolutely heart taking, or was when I was a child. It is a adventure book , about obnoxious girl, who become a orphan. She is sent to a mysterious house, to her relative. Mary is lonely as before, but she do not have anyone to order. Despite dreadful behaviour of hers, she gain sympathy of housekeeper. At night Mary is being woken up by some strange voices. Girl wants to solve a mistyfing source of noises at night. Plot was good, very interesting, and it definitely keep me amused for hours. I choose this book as one of the best from my childhood because, I was touched by it, and it tells about important things, of every kid, friendship. I definitely recomend this book to every child, but if that happend that some adult have not read it you should pick this one. 192 words, I should wrote some more (250) ... but it's just for education, I am still learning how to write this :) Please correct and tell my why I am wrong, and If style and build of Review is correct."

Polish,"I wondering whether Chinese is a ""good direction""... Today English is an International language. If you are working in field where very important is time of spreading information, I think I have noticed that the cost of making a translations are to high compared to learning language in which you will usually get information. Ages ago there were another International languages like Greek or Latin. I think English will not be an exception and it will also pass away from global scope. This not may take years, but maybe decades or even more, but I am sure that this will happen someday. If I have to point to another language, that can take this role, it would be a Chinese. I am really wondering about learning this language. I am not sure however, if this kind of motivation (usefulness) is a proper trigger. What do you think about this?"

Polish,"Few words about love and marriage. I don't know when I got married and I don't make plans to marry somebody. It's about love ;) I have to know that the person is the right person. Maybe I will find a perfect person for me in this year but I need time to know her. I think, a year is too little :) But I know one thing, for person I love, I'm ready to do everything and try to spend with her all time ;) Even if she is from Turkmenistan or other part of the world :) It doesn't matter :) The main issue in relationship for me is to do almost everything together, to be a unity and understand ourselves without words. For me, the case is simple. If I had a girlfriend from other country, one of us should move to live together. A long-distance relationship doesn't work in my opinion. Do you think you should follow your husband no matter what he say? I really don't know. It depends on relation between husband and wife. In my opinion it shouldn't be a rule. They should make decisions together and choose what is the best for their relationship. It's important to be open minded and to look for common goods. A husband shouldn't be a taskmaster and dictate what is good and what is bad. A husband and wife should support each other."
Polish,"most exciting day of my life It happened 07/07/2007. I slept when suddenly I felt a strange vibration. Vibrate not only my room but also every part of my body. Poured me a cold sweat. I was wondering it's a dream or waking ... Suddenly exploded window in the roof. When I looked up I was blinded by bright light. I was afraid, but I still looked in that direction because I wanted to see where is the source of light. I slowly rose from my bed ... Every second seemed to be hours ... And then I saw something that is beyond human comprehension. In my room materialized alien. He was tall and very slim. He had a big, yellow -violet eyes and blue skin. He touched my shoulder and in one second we were on the spaceship. That what I saw cannot describe in words ... Fear took the place of curiosity. Alien showed me many amazing things. He introduce me to other alien, and therefore I could talk with them for a long time. It was very untypical conversation because they didn't move their lips and I heard everything in my mind. I spent there many hours. I was fascinated by their technology as well as the principles which they profess. At the end of the journey, I found out why they contacted with me. They searched people who will be their ambassadors between their race, and race of people. They wanted teach me everything about them and someday in the future when appropriate time comes I could explain another peoples in the earth who are the newcomers from space. I agreed... I woke up in the morning and I didn't believe what happened. I didn't tell nobody, what I experienced. Now I'm waiting for the next meeting... Waiting for the next most exciting day of my life."

Polish,"Lost and found I've been always wondering why whenever I look for something I always find it in the last place possible. Have you ever experienced that? This/that is so annoying! The/a funny thing is I've recently seen a note on that awfully annoying situation in a science magazine published in Poland. A reader wrote a letter asking why it always happens so. And some wise journalist answered: we tend to find lost things in the last possible places because when we find them, we stop looking for them. I read it and thought - what a nice and neat answer. At first it seemed so simple and obvious but now the more I think of it, the more wrong it seems. Because it's simply not true. Just imagine. If it was true, after you'd found the missing stuff, there could still be some places left unsearched (I don't think there's a word like this...) and there usually aren't! When I find something, I always find it in the last possible place I could look for it - it's a fact! There is a notion which explains the situation, in Polish it's called ""zlosliwosc rzeczy martwych"" - I'm not using diacritics. No idea how to translate it into English, wait, my dictionary has just come to my aid, here you go: the perversity of inanimate objects. Hm, I don't like this translation very much but it's a good dictionary and it's probably better at English than I am, so the translation must be correct. Thanks for reading my idle chatter :) Comments will be most welcomed/welcome (?)."
Polish,"English in a Programmer's life - part 1. Part 1. I know that my English is not on this level, which is acceptable even for me, but I think, that I should try do something with this. We all should do something with the most important language for programmers! English is very important, but we can't expect that someone will teach us. Program of studies could be better. We know many fancy words, but often we can't express even our opinion about things which we are interested in. When I started work the biggest challenge was for me to switch to English. In our company English is the official language. I think that I am quite open mind person with a lot of ideas and question to ask, but sometimes when I need express something in language which is not my native, I am feeling a little confused. Of course this is natural, but if I want to be a person who want to achieve something special in my programmers live I need to be more world-wide! Many times I decided to do something to improve my English in significant way. Few years ago I decided, that I will be asking uncle Google in English (If I have to be honest, then I decided that I will try ;) ). This was not easy, but quickly I realized that web become much bigger for me. Since then googling is much easier :) Reading books written in English - this was also being very important step for me. I remember which foreign book was that first which I read from desk to the desk. It was . NET Book Zero. After reading this (btw. great and free - available online in pdf) book, I understood that sometimes choosing this (in theory) more difficult way, I can achieve something more quicker than by choosing (in theory) easier way for my - reading something about C Sharp in polish. Why? This is not obvious? In English there is much more content in the web and even probabilistic tells us that this mean, the perfect book about your favorite programming language is written rather in English than in Polish! So why we are wasting our very expensive time for reading not the best materials? That's enough! Lets do something with this!"

I've been learning English language for few years but I think I can't use it very well. Speaking is what I find the most difficult to me. Unfortunately I don't know any English speaking person, so I can't practice my speaking skills. English grammar is a bit hard to learn for me because of much more tenses and complicated gramatical structures. In my point of view Perfect Tenses are the most 'unnatural' for Polish guy cause in my language there are not any Perfect Tenses in the strict sense. I'd be grateful if you helped me to improve my writting skills doing some corrections of my posts. Bye."
Polish,"Today lesson Today I've been started learn English grammar. I know some rules, but never learned closely - only by hear. English grammar looks simpler than Polish, but it has many more prefix and sufix - befor and after any word. Parallel I have to learn new words and read much texts in English. If you correct me, thanks a lot."
Polish,"The most beautiful fountain I've ever seen! Believe or not, but in the city where I live there is one of the biggest fountain in Europe. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EJAxJ9uPY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PTPykWAG8s According to wikipedia: The one-hectare fountain incorporates about 300 jets to create a screen of water for animation display. It has something about 10 000 square-meter and shape of semicircle. The WrocÅ‚aw Multimedia Fountain, because that it's name, in the winter it becomes a great ice skating rink. I like skating, however I prefer watching amazing spectacles created by lights and falling water. You have to visit a WrocÅ‚aw and see this! I guarantee that this will blow your mind :) As I mentioned in my previous entry, there will be good a reason for such trip. A WrocÅ‚aw Multimedia Fountain is only one thing among dozens prepared for tourists, which are going to see upcoming European Football Championship hosted by my city. I am waiting here for you! :) P. S. Questions about topic of entry are welcome :) (even better videos are available on website: http://fontannawroclawska.com/) ------------------------------------------------------------------ I have a request for your. After reading this entry, please rate my English skills (in 1-10 scale) in this categories: correctness of grammar = ? complexity of used words = ? proper tenses = ? interest = ? :)"

Polish,"Come back Hey, I didn't write anything on lang-8 for a long, long time. Guess it was because fire in me did burn to the coal and I've lost my spirit :( But hey, here I am again and hopefully want to make my profile alive ^^ So, in the past two years I've changed a lot, now I'm certainly more tolerant, focusing on my studying, but not forgetting about friends :D My little (I mean something like ""silent"", that's only in me, is it correct?) dream is to go to Australia and see the normal (usual?) life of people living there, kangoos and all that great stuff. :) And that's all for now, bye ^_^"
Polish,"night owl I like to stay up untill late evening. And I really hate get up early in the morning but I have to due to my job. I am the most active after 10pm o'clock, but what to do, that's my nature. Consequently I am often half-conscious in the morning. I think I am a night owl. It seems to me that work hours have been set by early birds. Every morning when I go to bus stop I come across a women who is always weeding or watering plants in her garden . It's at 7.30 am. I can't imagine myself doing physical work so early. Fortunately my boss went on holiday so I can stay a little bit longer in bed for now."
Polish,"Hello everyone! I'm Catherine and I love learning foreign languages. I have been learning English for almost 10 years, but I still have big problems in communication. I make a lot of grammar mistakes and I don't know which tense is the most appropriate. I also learned Spanish, but now I have a two-year break. I hope I catch up during this summer holiday. In my opinion Spanish sounds amazing! At school I have had also Russian (very similar to Polish, but quite difficult) and German (I regret that I remember nothing. it's so bad, because I like this language too). I very admire people, who learn Polish. I know, that my mother tongue is quite... weird :)"
Polish,"Say Poland, say what? I don't really intend to improve my English here, but let's say if you correct this entry it's fair 'n square :D I'm making a little personal project and I'd like to ask you people to help me out a bit. Think about Poland for a little while and write down every association that strikes your minds. I mean everything: animals, vegetation, people (their looks, character, mentality), cuisine, weather, economy, political issues, customs, folklore, maybe some particular Poles you know, just anything that you think about when you think about Poland. It doesn't matter if you know anything about this country, whether you've lived there or have no idea what continent it's situated in, don't worry if you don't know whether what you think is true or not either. I just want to know how Poland looks like to people from outside this country. What kind of image does it create to the rest of the world and what kind of things are mostly associated with Poland. By the way, I'd better you simply listed those things or make some mental leaps rather than write a regular statement, because it's just easier this way. Thanks in advance, cheers from Poland :]"
Polish,"Sushi Bar Yesterday I was first time in sushi bar. Uncommon to me was the fact that before I even ordered anything waiters gave me a sticks, wasabi, sliced ginger, soia oil and of course a menu. I must say that they have very big variation of served food. After few minutes I told cook (Maybe he have some special title like sushi master but I don't know that so lets call him a cook) that I want green dish (because set of sushi is named from the color of dish on which it is served, different color = different food). Great idea in my opinion is fact that when you waiting for your food you can observe a cook or even talk with him because a bar table has got a big hole in the middle where cooks are preparing a food. When my food was ready and cook served it to me I took sticks from paper and then a new problem appeared. I don't know how to eat with sticks. Fortunately cook with the smile explained me how to use a sticks and told me that he can get me sticks with rubber band or I can eat with my fingers too. I chose last option because after few tries with sticks I give up. The food was delicious and after eating came time to pay a bill. I paid a bill and waiter gave me surprise, a small glass of plume wine. I'm waiting for another visit in sushi bar."
Polish,"It`s still raining It`s seventh day of raining weather! I can`t stand it anymore. I can`t go out, I can`t cycle and I can`t go jogging, which I should do every day -> it`s one of my holiday resolutions. So what can I do during these rainy days?

Polish,"blog-like introducton Okay, this is my first post in English here, so... Maybe some introduction? Firstly, I've never been seriously learning English (although after 8 years of having it at school, but I've never cared about it), but The Time Has Come, huh. I decided to improve my skills, since I'm stuck in a point when I watch movies with English subs or read some articles, but it's not anywhere near to fluency or level I'd be happy to achieve. I know that blog-like writing isn't really challenging, but it's a good point to start. ... Yeah, the REAL reason I've turned to English is that I blew my Japanese scholarship and I gave up the actual studying of it, although I'm still 'inputting' it. Maybe it'll bring better results, as so did my English 'inputting'. No, I'm just kidding. But only about the first part, unfortunately. Anyway, I'll decide about my next topic or maybe some kind of plot, maybe, after I see if there are a lot of mistakes here. Counting on your help, huh. Thanks in advance!"
Polish,"Torn apart Have you ever thought how hard is to choose a good major in studies? While most of the pupils enjoy the holiday wholeheartedly, future students stare at university's websites hopelessly. The pressure â€œHaven't you choose yet?â€œâ€“ said Dorothy's friend shaking her head. Dorothy replied something which always close everyone's mouth: â€œCan you propose me anything reasonable for humanists?â€ As time is passing by Dorothy feel more and more under pressure. The more advices she listens the bigger chaos she has got in her head. The fear that she will apply for an accidental major petrifies her. â€œ I wish I didn't ask anybody for the advicesâ€. When dreams meet reality Itâ€™s not that she is not a gifted student. Conversely, she won many various contests, however all in the humanists field. Unfortunately what the job market demands are scientifically-minded people, the builders of future bridges and those who understand sophisticated mechanisms of market and thanks for that are able to sell everything. The fact is that after many of humanistic majors you are sure to be unemployed, even if you were an active volunteer, had got rich apprenticeship or the most prestigious scholarship. You can be the best sociologist but nobody will take on you until you will be needed truly. Happiness is too ephemeral to be something which you can rely on. â€œIf I had choose the philosophy, I would have had to steal a bread from pigeonsâ€ â€“ says Linda. Despite economy is not something in which she is really interested in, it gives her a comfortable feeling of safety on unstable job market. What about you? Firstly, you should be aware that nowadays hardly anyone works in his or her profession. Undoubtedly, making an agreement between passion, skills and prospect of job is not an easy task, however you should be aware that you're devoting not only your 5 years of studies, but, most probably, you all future life also."

Now I feel better than befor. I know that I'm on the good way that my choice helps enviorement, living creatures. I wish other people will start realize how the truth about meat, farming really is. And about influence of meat at our health. Nowdays there is a great amount of informations on the net, there are vegetarians forums that help begginners. It isn't so hard to try understand and choose after knowing facts. I live on the village, near town. My whole life untill now I ate meat. It was normal to me because evryone ate meat.

So Iâ€™m Sylvia and Iâ€™ve just finished a high school in Poland and received result of my matura exam. I look like a common teenager who wears different clothes and mix different styles. Neither Iâ€™m an emo nor a punk. I donâ€™t like limiting anything. For example I like various kinds of music: from classical to electro through pop, rock or contemporary classical music. Iâ€™m a musician. Iâ€™m accordionist. Iâ€™ve been playing since 8 years and whatâ€™s more I decided to study in a music academy. But I got other hobbies like films and book. Iâ€™m fond of reading books which show peopleâ€™s problems with drugs or anorexia. As for the films I watch comedies, dramas and sometimes horrors but only when somebody induces me to do that. Spare time I spend like most of people â€“ I go out with friends to drink beer , go in the cinema or take part in at-home. Although I try to working on m English in spare time. I really like it. I do it by reading articles in the Net, watching films and listening song with lyrics. Recently I decided to join this website to improve my languages skills and help other people to learn Polish. Well then, theyâ€™re the most important things about me. If you want to know something more about me write me. :)"
Polish,"Medical Service For few weeks every big newspaper in the country has been writing about an idea, if the medical service should still be free. Healh Minister tries to convince poeoples of idea. It would be a great opportunity to fix a national budget, he said. When medical service is not free, people will go to the doctor only if they are seriously sic, so there is a chance that ques would be shorter. But most of people criticize Health Minister. The reason is quite simple - money. They are just worried. Everyone could be the victim of an accident. And what if it will be a poor man? Doctors let him to die? I just can't imagine that this situation would happen. I think it is not a good idea. Medicine service should be free for everyone, poeoples want to feel safe in the hospital, no matter how much they earn."

Polish,"Grammar: I talked to my cat. According to an old Polish legend (i don't know does it exist in different cultures) in the Christmas Eve, near midnight all animals can speak human language. Let's try some grammatic then: It's X-mas so i plan to have a little talk with my cat. Because of X-mas, I'm going to talk with my cat. My cat will talk to me, because it's X-mas. My cat wouldn't talk to me, if there will be no X-mas. X-mas time is a time, when I can have a talk with my cat. X-mas is the thing that makes my cat talk to me. I was a little surprised when I was talking to my cat first time, many X-mas' before. My ability to talk to my cat is caused by X-mas. While celebrating the X-mas i will try not to forget to try talking to my cat. I realized that the X-mas are coming, when my cat begin to talk to me. I will not be able to talk to my cat for the whole next year, after the X-mas will end. I used to talk to my cat during X-mas. Finally, the X-mas arrived, so I'll be able to talk to my cat once more! I wouldn't mind if my cat will talk to me, because of X-mas. Well actually my cat told me last year, that it is a Muslim so it's not going to anything special during ""my"" X-mas. I was just talking to my cat as usual when suddenly, out of nowhere - the X-mas appeared! I hope my cat will be glad to have an opportunity to have a little talk with me this X-mas. Actually I had talked to my cat before, on the last X-mas. Since there are X-mas, I'll probably talk to my cat. Ey ppl i rly like xmas, coz yle its on, i can talk to ma kat! I like talking to my cat, which is possible because of X-mas. Meow meow meow, meow meow meow X-mas. Seriously, during X-mas I don't think talking to my cat is any weird. I hope my cat will be very talkative this X-mas. I used to talk to my cat, even if there's not X-mas. I hope my cat is not going to tell me, that it's not interested in talking to me, even during X-mas, because I really think that so good opportunity to have a talk is too valuable to be wasted for both me and my cat. That will be enough for now. Merry X-mas people, and don't forget to say ""hello"" to your pets! :)"
Polish,"recension 'Mammia mia', directed by Phyllida Lloyd, is a movie based on popular musical which includes 27 Abba songs. The main character, Amanda Seyfried plays young, beautiful girl Sophie, brought up on one of the greek's island only by her mother Donna,starring Meryl Streep. Donna, the single mum who is the owner of a dilapidated island tavern is about to celebrate the wedding of her only daughter. Sophie wants her father to take her down the aisle but because her mother led rather multifaceted private life, she doesn't know who her father is. Anyway, Sophie invites all the possible candidates(Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard), while her mum brings together her two best friends(Julie Walters and Christine Baranski) for a bit of moral support. The young fiancee hopes to unravel a mystery and find her dad... Because 'Mammia mia' is a musical, the most important role plays the music. Dialogues breake into the songs, which performance is truly remarkable. They just makes you wanna stand up, sing and dance with other characters. Streep is the real star here although the other actors play in a gripping way too and it's impossible to get bored while watching this movie. 'Mammia mia' set in picturesque and breathtaking Santorini is a great choice for those who got stuck in their daily grind, unable to spend unforgettable holidays. It will allow them to get brief respite, relax and experience exciting adventure."
Polish,"Hello! Recently, I watched ""A single man"" movie with Colin Firth as a protagonist and briliant Julianne Moore. The story is about George who lost his lover in car accident and show one day - the most important day - from George's life. Very delicate and peaceful film. Pictures from this movie are great. Also music composed by Abel Korzeniowski with Shigeru Umebayashi help is moving. To sum up: for me it's movie about true and passionate love. :) Now I'm fascinated with backpacking idea. It's just beacuse of Tomek Michniewicz's book ""Samsara"". It's about journey through Southeast Asia. I think it's great idea just to take your bag and go wherever you want to. The book inspired me much with the idea of wayfaring, so maybe one day I'll pack my backpack and go somewhere... . :)"

Its in the centre of the forest, 100 meters from the water. Every night we are making campfire. With my parents, sister and dog we are sitting around it and talking about unimportant things. I enjoy it very much! In this holiday, weather wasn't very good, but it doesn't matter. We spend a lot of time together and it was great time. In other hand, i was at a trip (camp?) in Bulgaria. This part of my holiday was also great. People there were very friendly and we were partying all the time. We stayed at hotel ""Mak"" in Golden Sands. I must say - this place looks like a paradise. Beach was just awesome! In the morning we were swimming and sunbathing and in the evening and night we went to the clubs/discos. Enjoyed it too. :) So, i think its enough for first post. I hope that someone will make some corrects. Best regards, Krzysiek."

Polish,"Hi everyone! Hi everyone! My name is Peter, I'm 20 and I live in GdaÅ„sk, Poland. I've been learning English for over 13 years (wow, it's already that long... :D). The truth is that at the very beginning of my ""adventure"" with English, it was like once or twice a week at school, and everyone knows how much you can learn at school if talking about foreign languages. So, those ""13 years"" are highly exaggerated. I'm really glad I can understand almost everything what's written, and about - let's say - 95% what I hear. I've just found Lang-8 - it's exactly what I need right now! I feel that the only way I can still practice my English is some contact with casual, everyday English. I think watching USA and British TV series is awesome, 'cause it's both fun and learning. I've watched Monk, Desperate Housewives, some time ago also House and Ugly Betty. I think the first two (which I've watched till now) are easiest to understand, their English is just so clear I can easily watch them without subtitles. It was a little bit harder with House, probably because of a lot of medical terminology (""tumor"" and ""concussion"" being only a tip of the iceberg). All right, that would be all for my first post.

I am very surprised that my last entry, 'A not typical day of an American English learner', has no corrections and comments. Is it correct? I think it's not - I found there a few mistakes by myself (by example in the title - I should use 'an unusual' instead of 'a not typical'). So maybe it was boring or too long? ;> Yesterday, i found some very good, free e-book on the Internet. It's called 'Polyglot - How I Learn Languages'. It's author, Kato Lomb have spoken very well in 16 languages - in most of them fluently. Yes, it's true, sixteen! You can find this e-book here: http://bit.ly/fQ9Vep and I can really recommend it to you ;>"
Polish,"Which way to go, which language to chose? I'm a web developer. I went this way cause it gave me easy chance to earn some money. But now, when I have some clients I can go further and try something else. That's why I'm considering trying other, application programming languages. I'm thinking about C++ but on the other side are languages like Python, C# or Java. It will take years for me to learn some of those languages so I need to make a good decision."

Polish,"VS 2008 question (Copy of a programming/VS 2008 question I asked on one forum) I'm working under Visual Studio 2008, maybe that's important. In a larger project I decided to split one of my . cpp files into two. As I moved some of the functions to a new file, let's call it new. cpp, and tried to compile, I got errors that new. cpp doesn't know definitions of fstreams, setw(), etc. Now, at the very top of the new file I included my own header, let's call it main_header. h, which in turn includes all the necessary fstream, iomanip, etc. This works just fine all throughout older files used in this project, but for some reason doesn't in new. cpp. If I add #include <fstream> #include <iomanip> // and all the rest in new. cpp then all works just fine, but that's not how I want to solve it. I thought maybe content of main_header. h doesn't get appended to new. cpp on compilation, but that's not true, I tried using in new. cpp an external variable declared in main_header. h and defined in yet different . cpp, and got no errors on compilation, linking, or running. Yet it seems like fstream and iomanip included in main_header. h do not make it to new. cpp file. I'm relatively new to Visual Studio, so the solution to my problem is likely something silly I'm not aware of, but I spent a good while trying to figure this one out and to no avail. The new file is definitely part of the project, since building projects attempts to compile it, plus once I include iostream and iomanip in this new. cpp I can call its routines in other parts of the project. Any ideas what I might be doing wrong? main_header. h looks like that #ifndef MAIN_HEADER #define MAIN_HEADER #include <iomanip> #include <fstream> // loads of other stuff #endif // for MAIN_HEADER"
Arabic,"Wrong E-mail, Very Shocking! A couple had been married for 20 years. They decided to spend the summer in the same hotel where they spent their honey moon, but the wife was busy, so she agreed with her husband that he would travel alone two days a head, then she could catch up with him later. When the husband had arrived at the hotel, he went up to his room, and found a computer connected to the internet. So, he thought that he should send his wife an e-mail to inform her of his arrival. Unfortunately, he sent this e-mail to a wrong e-mail address that wasn't his wife's. The wrong e-mail address was a widow's address who had just came back from her husband's funeral. She started checking her inbox going through all the condolences messages. Then, suddenly, she fainted. Her son tried to wake her up, but he couldn't. Then he read the following message which was displayed on the screen: ""My dear wife, I arrived safely. You might be surprised that you're getting my news via the internet. They have computers in here now, can you believe it? Now, anyone can e-mail their family and loved ones day by day. I have just arrived an hour ago. I checked that everything was set, just waiting for your arrival in two days time. I miss you! I wish you will get a fast and comfortable flight like mine. P. S: You don't have to bring a lot of clothes with you, its very, very hot in here. It's Hell!"" Very romantic to his wife; very shocking to the widow!"
Arabic,"Working in July, again! I can not believe I'll have to work during July this year too! My vacation will be in August, and it is for 50 days! When I say this to friends and family living up north, they say, ""You're lucky"" because they only have between 20 and 30 days holiday. But they do not know how it is to work in a small town in the summer where temperatures hit 50C Â°! Every time I spend July here , I became increasingly tetchy, and suporte less the heat and the sensation of isolation! I wanted to take my vacation at least mid-July, but I could not because of work. Well, it's only five weeks ... There is an idiom used here to mean that the temperatures are unbearable, they say, even the camel bleeds (from nose) because the very high tempratures cause nose bleeds, and if the camel that is supposed to stand the heat, bleeds! It means that the heat is beyond human capacity!"
Arabic,"Every one wins and no one lose. Thousands of people know that they need things from other people but the shame owns them in the pursuit of what they need. Because they fear that their satisfaction and filling to their desires just selfish of them. They also feel that their insurance for their success and their happiness mean that there is other will deprive from some success or happiness. Letâ€™s take it directly and say that the successful human relations means give everyone else something else, what is needed compared to anything else you need it. And any other method to deal with people will not produce or bear fruit. The three main methods to deal with people:- There is not the man who was self â€“sufficiency, all of us need to do things others can provide it. You also have things which other people need them. All our dealings with people is based on this requirements and there are only three ways are being used in our dealt with other people. 1-You can take what you need from you colleague by force, threat or deception although the criminal who are fall into this type of people. However, more of respected people restore to use this way with more subtle methods. 2-You can become a beggar for human relations and begging the other to give you these things which you need. This compliant type of characters are dealing with other in this way will not impose my self on you and I will not cause any problem for you so in return that you will be kindness with me. 3-You can work free from a base based on the fair exchange or on the basis of give â€“and â€“take. Here your job is to give others what they require and need then they should return your work and give you the things which you need. I prefer the third method because it makes you happy when you help people and make them very happy because they may be need your help most. Also when you find some one help you in things actually you need his/her help most, you donâ€™t know how can you thanks him/her. Keys of success and happiness. We need from life just two things . they are success and happiness. We all are different from each other and our idea about success is different from one to another. But there is a major factor will put to teach us how we can be able to success and become happy. This is the same factor which found in each case whether you are a lawyer , doctor , a businessman or salesperson ,whether you are a parent or just a sales clerk or even a housewife ,and so on. The scientific studies proved that if you learned how to deal with others, you are cut off 85% of the road to success in any business or job and 99% from the way of personal happiness."
Arabic,"Be peaceful with people I think that most of people like the peace. When you Live in peace,you can do your work,improve your living conditions , as you feel stability. When someone smile to you, you feel happiness. We can with small actions happy others, make them peaceful. It's great to be helpful to others,to be proactive in helping them that make them feel peace too. Another thing when people love each other. Everyone has good wishes for others . I hope that peace bring to all the world,and all people feel peace inside their hurts."

B- Oh, that completely sneaked up on me!! It's 6:30 ( In the book I took those idioms from they said you'll mostly hear people use the past form ""snuck "".

Arabic,"My Grandmother. My Grandmother was visited us yesterday. she has been living in other city.

Also, she told me about game which she play when she was child. I'm had been interesting with her. I want stay all the time together."
Arabic,"Tipping Around the World A few days ago, I watched Oprah Winfrey Show. She was talking about tipping in a very dramatic way. It seemed like not tipping is a very rude thing to do. I didn't really understand what the concept of tipping means in the USA and other countries. So, I did a little research, and here is what I came up with: United States: It seems like one has to tip for everything is done for them. It's like showing appreciation. Thus, the one who doesn't tip is being ungrateful. In some restaurants, they just add the 15% tip to the bill. The BBC says, â€œ For all those US males out there who pull out their little calculators every time they receive the bill, having the tip already indicated for them can save a lot of embarrassment.â€ Very awkward! Canada: It is pretty much similar to the US's tipping system. It also depends on which city and level of service. Tips in Canada range between 10-20%. A 15% tip is considered fairly good but if the service is very good, then you're expected to push this number more steps forward. Mexico: They say that tipping there is expected for almost everything (I really can't see the difference that it has from the previous two countries). Also here, a 15% tip is expected in restaurants. It's said that there are people who don't have any other source of living except for these tips. I find this very confusing because how is this called a job. I mean there must be a manager who hired this person and who is expected to pay him, as well. Coming back to Mexico, If you're taking a taxi, you should check the metre as you enter the cab. If it's broken, you should exit, otherwise,you're expected to pay what the metre shows at the end of the ride. The tip can be lowered if the cab driver was giving you a hard time through your ride. France: The expected tipping percentage doesn't differ here from the others. The law in France states that the tipping price should be included in the bill. Customers should feel free to increase the tipping price unless they are feeling dissatisfied with the service (but I don't think one can decrease the tipping price for this reason). There are much more counties with many other tipping systems, but let'stalk about my own country. The article that I read about tipping shows tipping system in Egypt in a different way than what it really is. The writer says that in Egypt you're expected to tip, which makes it sound compelling. I think tipping here is considered optional. In other words, no one will fight with you if you don't tip, as the law doesn't state any rules for tipping. Therefore, tipping generally depends on one's generosity. To be fair, I agree with him on one thing, some workers might look aggrieved if you don't tip them. But as I said, it's completely optional. People get paid for doing their jobs. No matter how small they are paid, they should expect living on this salary. If they were tipped, then it's even better. But as getting tipped is not guaranteed, then the decision of taking a job depends only on the salary."

Arabic,"Eid-Alfitar Eid-Alfitar is an event usually and ordinarily staged by religious community, which is a group of people practice the same religion and ,it is the two most important islamic celebrations. Eid-Alfitar is happen in the first day of Shawal month,which follows Ramadan and,we are celebration because we are break-fasting after complete one month of fasting. Before the day of Eid, during the last few days of Ramadan,each muslim family gives a charity to the poor people such as money or food. On the day of Eid, muslims wake up early in the morning and go in outdoor locations or masques to perform the Eid prayer. For example,they recite the takbir all throughout the period of Eid. After the Eid prayer,they usually scatter to visit various family and friends and give gifts for children. for instance, they are dancing and eating. The two most important islamic festival is Eid-Alfitar and it is organize by local community."
Arabic,"How to know you are old! First I have to say that I love football Iâ€™m not addicted to it; I donâ€™t watch games all the time or get mad of a result. I watch just few matches from the European Champion League and the Italian Championship. When it comes to the World Cup, I became addicted; I have to see almost all the games, know all the teams playing; their players, their coach, results... This year was a little different, since our national team qualified to the World Cup, I watched some of their qualifications matches So when I saw the list of players going to South Africa I was not surprised. But when I take a look on other teamâ€™s lists, I didnâ€™t recognize a lot of names; because Iâ€™ve forgot some of them since 2006, but mostly because they are new. My big surprise was when I saw the Italian list and there was no Del Piero on it!! I looked for Buffon, Canavaro and Camoranizi, and thank God they were there. I checked the list more then once, and looked on other websites to confirm it, until I found some articles confirming Del Piero and Totti absence from the â€œMondialâ€. I didnâ€™t understand how they could do this!! How could Lippi do this? Well, itâ€™s true he is 35 years old, and in the world of football it considered very old; but he still plays and scores in his club, and he is irreplaceable!! Now, I remember that I hated when older person use to say that such player or singer or any public personal from the past is irreplaceable or is the best. I think that they just like people from the time they was younger I thought I would never do that; I like new things and changes, but it seems itâ€™s just a human nature. ... Still, Del Piero is irreplaceable! :P"

Arabic,"Food in Saudi Arabia The most important meal in Saudi Arabia is lunch, and the least important is breakfast. In breakfast and sometimes in dinner we have light food, jam, cheese, egg, olive... etc. And ofcourse bread. Here we use bread to pick up food. It's a main thing in all courses. And sometimes we have pancake or Arabic meals like fool, Hummus, taamiaah. In lunch the main food is rice, we eat it around everyday. We have heavy meals with it like chicken, meat, fish, soap.. etc. There are many ways to make chicken for example, and every method make a new meal. So, we have a lot of choices. We also eat Italian food, Chinese food, Indian food... And there are traditional or Arabic meals like mantoo, mahshii,samboosa,shawirma... Saudi Arabia is famous of its Kabsa. It's meat and rice. We make these food at home and sometimes we order from restaurants. we have many famous restaurants like KFC, Pizza Hut, Chili's, Mcdonald's, Chucke Cheese. We don't eat pork meat or drink alcohol. Because we are Muslims and they are prohibited for us. Also, Saudi Arabia is famous of Arabic coffee. When guests come to our houses we serve it to them first. We usually don't use forks or knives to eat lunch, we just use spoons and sometimes bread. Some people eat on the table, and another sit on the floor. About desserts, Syria is famous of it. It makes very delicious desserts. I like baqlawah much. Dates here are very popular especially in the holy month of Ramadan. We eat it with breakfast. Those triangle things in the picture are called sambosa. It filled with different things, chicken, meat, cheese... And they are very popular in Ramadan. Those Sandwiches are shawirma, it made by chicken in a special way. The last one is baqlawa."

Arabic,"I Hate Waiting! I hate waiting, I really do. I'd prefer that the bad thing happens than to keep questioning whether what will happen is going to be bad or good. I try to convince myself that ""no news is good news,"" but I don't think that I honestly believe that. I just keep imagining the best-case scenario and the worst-case scenario, mostly it's the worst. Waiting is hard enough, and it's even harder when there are some decisions, depend on what one's waiting for, need to be made. Sometimes, it becomes painful, without any pain medicine that can be taken. I don't think that they have invented any medicine for that. And by medicine, I don't mean pills, I mean sort of distraction, or something that might take ones attention away from the thing that they waiting for. So, there isn't a general rule to cure one from the tension of waiting. It just depends on the surroundings and friends. These are the only two factors that one's waiting tension depends on."

Arabic,"The life story of great hawks Does the wise man learn from this story? Falcon lives up to 70 years but for Falcon living these ages it is to make a difficult decision. When it become in 40 years old its nail becomes weak that was flexible to capture the prey which is the source of its food. Its strong and sharp beak becomes crooked and very strong bow. Because of advanced age, its wings become heavy because of the heavy weight of feathers and glue to the chest and the air becomes very difficult for him. Theses circumstance put the Falcon in front of two options: Either to succumb to death or puts itself to the painful process of changing the last 150 days. The process requires that the Hawk flew to the top of the mountain where the nest. The Falcon beats its beak on a rock till its crooked introduction break. When Falcon finished from break its beak, it waits till its new beak grows again. It then broke it claws as well. After growing its claws, Falcon starts plucking its old feathers. After five months, the Falcon starts to fly in its new trip as it born again. Falcons live after this change another 30 years. Why do you need to change? In many times, we need to undergo to change if we want to adapt to the reality. I know that the process of change may force us to get ride of old memories and inherent and bad traditions. Our freedom from the burdens of the past (what is negative) is only the way to take advantage of our present and planning fro our future."
Arabic,"Beyond The Words There is always a ""TRUTH"" behind ""I'AM JUST KIDDING"", a little ""EMOTION"" behind ""I DUN CARE"", a little ""PAIN"" behind ""IT'S OKAY"", a little ""I NEED YOU"" behind ""LEAVE ME ALONE"" and a lot of ""WORDS"" behind ""THE SILENCE""...!!!! This is one of the best sayings I've ever heard. It's like a common secret that everybody feels but nobody reveals. Sometimes, people use ""I'm just kidding"" as an excuse when the other side gets mad at them for saying something. I mean people often use this when they insult someone; and to make it's effect lighter, they would says ""I'm just kidding"" -- like this is supposed to make them feel better about it. People say ""I don't care"" day and night. And to be honest, I think sometimes it's emotionless at the time it is said, but when this thing actually happens, the emotions start to climb to the surface. For example, person A and B have been fighting for a while. This is the last bit of their conversation: A: I DUN CARE if you were run over by a truck or hit by a drunk driver. B: I DUN CARE if you were stabbed or kidnapped. You see, it's completely impossible that there wouldn't be any emotions if some of the horrible actions that they wished for the other partner came true. I think that's what urges some suicidal thoughts in some people against whom ""I DUN CARE ABOUT YOU ANY MORE"" has been used. They would like to test the credibility of this sentence. Again, sometimes -- I have to use sometimes a lot because generalizing my point of view would be unrealistic --, one says ""leave me alone"" and waits for insistence from the other person to stay. Maybe one wants to make sure that the issue really matters to the other person and that they truly want to bring some happiness -- or in other cases, find solutions -- to get things back on the track. Finally, ""THE SILENCE"" itself is a behaviour. One could talk for hours and convey nothing to the other person while they could have saved their breath and silenced to convey their meaning in a glimpse. A funny Egyptian story about silence, it's a proverb actually but there is a story that lies behind it. ""Silence is a sign of satisfaction"". When a suitor comes to the bride's father to propose to the daughter, later on, the father would go to the girl and asks her whether she accepts the man as her husband or not. If she was silence, this means she accepts him but she is too shy to say yes. The story is very old I think because no one uses this technique any more. But we use the proverb in another mean way. It is used when a person is just being polite -- or timid -- by not refusing doing something others ask him to, so he gets silent, and people would say ""silence is a sign of satisfaction"" when it's very apparent that this person don't want to do it. I'm so sorry for the long entry, it's been a long time since I wrote anything so I thought I should make it up to you.:)"
Arabic,today i went to Auckland library today .
Arabic,"Is it the End of the World ? Hi I haven't write any entry for more than a month. Actually I wasn't really busy but you can say I was mentally busy ! Many things happened since the beginning of the 2011, This year seems hiding many events and surprises for us. Many people start talking about the end of the world in 2012. I don't personally believe inï»¿ the 2012 phenomenon but also I don't deny that the end of the world is soon and what is happening now is a clear sign for that Ending. There's been a lot of strange things happening recently. Revolutions, Tsunamis, Global Worming, Earthquakes all of these events haven't happened before in such a short time. Some people don't agree with me and say that nothing new in this world. Wars and natural disasters happened before but the open media plays a big role to present the world as this madness. By looking at the calender. I can't believe that we are still in March. My last entry was in at the end of January and it was about the uprisings in the Middle East. When I wrote that entry it was the beginning of Egyptian revolution. In only one month. The revolution succeeded an it spreads across many Arabs countries. I can't believe how all of these things happened in only one month ! Many things we used to be for decades change in only few days. The idea that any change needs time isn't necessarily true ! Many people here are worried and have concerns about the future, Whether these revolution would make better future or to more struggles and corruptions. Many people are concerned that these peaceful protests may lead -in the worst case- to a civil war or to many victims before it reach its goals like what is happening now in Libya. Every thing around me talking about politics. New Breaking news coming in every minute. Social network transformed to be political websites. Even In my college every one speaks about what is happening now. you can hear different opinions and negotiations which is never happened before. Far from Politics to Japan, The massive earthquake and Tsunami was really scary. I feel bad for this disaster. I know that some natural disaster are out of control but the number of victims was high, and the nuclear leak make the whole world concerned and rethink about the safety of using nuclear power. Future seems like a fog to me I can't predict what will happened next week rather than in few months or years but I dream for a better future and peace every where."

Look at Ibn Battuta as a man of exceptional genius in narrative literature, came out in his adventures to distant lands and explore the unknown in his travels around the world an exciting story to tell us which reflects the great cultures of many peoples in the world of his time. Due to what is stated in the manuscript of Ibn Battuta famous, considered by Eastern and Western intellectuals, both as a man with open eyes to the world. And Ibn Battuta is an example of the greatness of the exploration Arab in the past, a figure not only represents his hometown of Tangier, country Morocco, but generally represents the Arab and Islamic world in the literature of the journey the world can be proud of its Arab and Islamic world to the feet of mankind important information about the world. But despite the impressive global character of Ibn Battuta, including his literary text, photo, does not negate the possibility of offering the hypothesis, which says that perhaps you might imagine stories of his travels or transported to San others based on the literature of its predecessors, and information collected without the notes to her or to her, if you I can travel back in Time, I wanted to be in the era of Ibn Battuta, so explore with him and who know what lured in some countries, and what the incentive paid to travel and write about those countries .. In my personal view is of the greatest Arab who tried to indicate in the culture of other peoples .."
Arabic,"Beautiful Songs Remember the English course I'm having? In this course, the professor makes us listen to a song and try to guess the lyrics. He had chosen two wonderful songs, each of which made it very hard for me to suppress my tears. I'm sure that they are old enough for all native speakers to be already familiar with it. I love the quiet songs that at some point don't become quiet any more but they make you feel the greatness of the moment. You know at the end of a movie when they use some song when the champion receives a medal or when the miracle finally happens. This is the kind of songs I like. But I don't know what this type of music is called, so could you please listen to the next songs -- the ones we listened to in the course -- and tell me what's the type of the music in there? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d2_tNxBxhY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPCfdzyRJus"
Arabic,"Expected Actions When I start reading to some specific writer who their writing captures my attention, I become crazy about their books. So, I start going through one of their book after another. After a reading two of their books, I become familiar with their style. After reaching four books, the actions of the characters in their books become very predictable to me. This is what annoys me. I can't enjoy a whole series of books written by a specific author. Once I get used to the style, I have to start the hunt for another good author that their work interests me, and believe me, this last condition limits the possible options, if there are any. It's very annoying not to be able to follow a whole series to the end, but at the same time, it's a blessing because I get exposed to many ways of thinking as well as a variety of experiences."

Arabic,"You Keep Your Grade And I'll Keep My Dream When Fred Smith (the founder of FedEx company) was in his senior year at college Yale University, his professor asked him to make a paper that represents one of his dreams. Fred thought about making this paper about transferring mails around the world in short time that doesn't exceed two days. His professor saw that this is an infeasible idea and that people wouldn't need something like that. He got a C or a D for that project, of that I'm not sure. His professor promised to give him a high grade only if he changed the idea of his paper to a more feasible one. To that he replied, ""You keep your grade and I'll keep my dream."" When Fred finished college, he started bringing his idea into real life. He started with eight mails, lost some money at the beginning, made a complete joke out of himself but he fought for it and in the end he made his company the biggest one in the field. I don't know whether the details are true or not. A friend of mine sent me this story (in Arabic) and I thought it is worth sharing regardless of its credibility ."

Arabic,"Alexandria. Alexandria is one of the most important cities in Egypt. It is considered as the second largest city after Cairo. In addition, it is known as the pearl of Mediterreanean. Alexandria has a very great heritage which distance it from the rest of the country although it is only 225km from Cairo. It is called Alexandria according to Alexander The Great who found it in 331 BC. Alexandria is famous for its costal weather which makes it wonderful all the time especially in summer. Alexandria is regarded as one of the most crucial source of tourism and national income. This is because of its great sights and its great location. Alex has many different beautiful and charming areas sush as Mamoura, Montaza, and Agamy. These areas are full of attractive sights espescially El Mamoura. Last weak I traveled to it and I spent nonforgotable four days. I enjoyed everything there the weather, the sea, and everything. Even the people there are very kind and helpful. But to tell you the truth I get bothered because I had to pay money to enter the beach. I got bothered because I am persuaded that the owner of everything is our God, and God allow us to enjoy the nature freely without any limitations or money. I am persuaded that nature is for all, the poor, and the rich. there is also somthing wich annoyed me, I found that the main beach is devided into a beach for the local people, and a beach for the high class people. This makes me feel inferior to these people of the private beach. It is unfair to devide the nature according to the people classes. It is very painfull to realize that God gave us everything but the people can do anything to deprive the others from these godly gifts just to collect money as best as they can. Really, from the bottom of my heart I say what a pity."

Arabic,"please correct my mistake Mobiles! How can we live without it. They became the important items we should have . They are with us where ever we go . They make us feel safety and confident. They keep us in touch with our friends ,family and relatives . Mobiles have advantages and disadvantages In the recent years, mobiles have developed . They have a lot of technologies ,models and sizes . They are used by seniors ,young people and children . In my opinion ,mobiles help us in many cases but they also cause a lot of health problems . Even with that problems we still use them . However , they make our life easier and they can help us to be in touch with our friends ,family and also with our job. Sometimes they disturb us especially when we are study or work. I think mobiles are the best invention in the world . they help us to be safety . They have a suitable size to carry them where ever we want to go . we can communicate with anyone ,everywhere at anytime . They make our life more fixable ."

Arabic,"iPhone4 VS. BlackBerry Nowadays, it's the fashion here to have either iPhone (specifically iPhone4) or BlackBerry. The BlackBerry's fashion started about year ago. And five or six months ago, the iPhone4 started to compete it. Most students in the university have BlackBerry, you can see it everywhere. People who have BlackBerry waste their whole time using its chatting service. They don't move their eyes from it, and once they start a chat , they lose their sense of everything around them. I just wondering, don't they get bored chatting all the time?!! About those who have the iPhone, they spend their time using its applications. It's something like and addiction, as soon as they get one of these devices, they become addicts â€“especially, BlackBerry users- Actually, I'm seeing my older brother, he can't spend an only hour without using his iPhone!! In the university, I noticed that some of those students try to show the others that they have an iPhone4 or a BlackBerry. They hang it around their necks. So, it can be reachable, and at the same time all people can see what they have. Some have both of them, and they carry them at the same time. I can't understand why do they think like this silly way!! I repeat that I refer to some users not the all. I'm talking about my city, I don't know if the same thing is happening in another countries. But one of my Colombian friends told me that they also have this fashion in Colombia. About me, I'm really satisfied with my Nokia mobile. It's still new, why I'd replace it with another mobile?! http://www.safeshare.tv/v/ZfdXud-Kzys In this link you can watch a funny video shows the competition between these two companies. In the first part of this video, you'll see how BlackBerry tries to prove its existence. And the second part shows how Apple reply to that message as the same way.

Arabic,"Forbidden Actually,it's been a while since I have read a book that really drew me in. As an avid reader you come across dozens and dozens of books hoping the next one you pick up will either move you to challenge your belief system,take you on an emotional roller-coaster,make you feel hate,happiness,or simply just close the book when you're done and say to yourself ""WOW"" that was TERRIFIC. I am totally exhausted emotionally and psychologically after reading this book,I don't think I'll ever....... EVER forget this masterpiece for that matter. The content shocked me,the writing and delivery left me in awe. ""Forbidden"" by Tabitha Suzuma is a novel about a brother and sister who try to raise their three other siblings and pick up the pieces from their abandoned father and alky mother that leaves them to fend everything in this dark world by themselves,By the time they have become much more than brother and sister ,they have fallen in love with each other,a love that can never be allowed. I believe this book is the most controversial issue ,but also one of the most ballsy,powerful and emotionally charged YA novel that I have ever read ,it made me think ,feel ,ask:How can something that feels so wrong, be so wrong, feel so right?! Even though it was amazing but I find it hard to recommended due to the taboo subject matter. But it's definitely a book that you have to decide for yourself. Anyways,beyond absorbing,memorizing and breathtakingly brilliant:FORBIDDEN was quite the unforgettable experience. My favorite quote ""You can close your eyes to the things you do not want to see, but you cannot close your heart to the things you do not want to feel."""

Arabic,"I'm on my own now I've been translating stories from Arabic to English since I got here . I translated stories that I loved and thought they were inspiring to me and I wanted to share them with others. But it didn't really tell me if I'm a good writer or not. Learning a new language and being a good writer in this language are completely two different things. Learning a new language isn't so hard. With memorizing a lot of vocabulary, memorizing idioms and learning grammar rules; it becomes handy. While writing in this language is a whole new level which requires seriousness, determination and a lot of reading and writing. I know it's not going to be easy, and it's going to take more time. But I need to know if I can write or not. Translating my thoughts is a lot harder than translating a written article. But why don't I give it a try? I might translate some stories from time to time, if I found some good ones. I might write a story by myself. No, just kidding! I can't write stories, it's very advanced for me. I don't think that my writings are going to be great, because I'm not going to push myself to write something that isn't me. So, whether you think it's trivial or brilliant, it's going to be the real me. I might express my feeling, my perspective or write about trivial things (when I don't find anything to write about). The point is that I want to keep writing even if I don't have a good topic to talk about. Writing about trivial things might not help me very much with learning to write impressive phrases, but it will definitely help me withÂ vocabulary and grammar. So the bottom line is that: I'm trying to express, and not to impress. Wish me luck!"
Arabic,"The advantages and disadvantages for having a car Nowadays cars becoming very important. people can't live with out it. We have many davantages and disadvantages for having cars. First of all, you can finish your things in the short time by cars. For example If you want to buy something like food, or clothes you will go shopping buy your cars in the short time. Also if you have emergency problem, like someone sick you will take that person to a hospital in the short time. Furthermore, it's easy to travel to other citise by cars. For example, If you travel to other city by your car, you can go to any places you want. However, If you travel by bus, the bus driver has station his will stop in it, then you should take anothe kinds of transport. On the other hand, cars have disadvantage like air pollution. For example too much cars in the street. When people walk beside the street they will smell the carbon coming from the car, then they will get sick after long time. Also cars make people lazy. Many people stop doing sport after they having a car, so we should try to do soprt even we have a car. To sum up, cars have many advantages and disadvantges.

Arabic,"The Impossible is nothing In one of the universities in Colombia, one of the students attended a math lecture. He sat in the back of the hall and slept quietly. At the end of the lecture, he wake up on the students voices leaving the hall. Before leaving, he noticed that the professor has written two mathematical problems on the white board. So he wrote them down in his notebook and left the hall. When he came back home, he started solving those problems. They were very hard. So he went to the university's library, picked up some references and started working them out again. After 4 days, he was able to solve the first problem but he was feeling very angry with his professor for giving them such a hard assignment. In the next lecture, the professor didn't ask about the assignment, he was very surprised about that. So he went up to the professor and told him that the first problem took him 4 days and 4 pages to solve it. The professor was very surprised, he told the student that he didn't give any assignments. ""Those 2 problems that I wrote on the white board, was an example of the mathematical problems which the greatest scientist couldn't work out at all. "" The professor explained. The negative contentment is what stopped scientists from solving this problem. So if this student was awake while the professor was telling them that solving this problem is impossible, he wouldn't be able to solve it. So I guess sleeping in the lecture worked for him that time, but don't try it though. He explained to his professor how and why he solved this problem. The solution of this problem with it's 4 pages, is still exhibited there in this university. When I first heard this expression, ""The Impossible is nothing"" . I couldn't understand it nor believe it. But this story proves the credibility of this statement. It's just the negative contentment which makes us believe that the impossible exists but the reality proved that it's all nonsense."

I canâ€™t believe that the talk about the destruction of Al-Aqsa in the Zionism press became so badly that actually knows that the temperature of blood and jealousy of religion had been discontinued in the veins of people. When I heard that AL- Aqsa will destroyed I cried and my heart burned from the severity of pain and I wondered how long will we stay in our place without doing any thing. Are the Jews having a heart? The answer is no because how can they have a heart and they kill the child, women and destroy the Palestine houses. More children lost their parents or lost one of them. Are any one accepting on what happen now in Palestine? For any one Muslim or Christian if your family is destroyed and you became alone in the world what will you do? The things which will happen to you actually happen now to the people in Palestine. I think, you will do more and more or you will do as you can to do. So why not start moving a correct step to forward? When we start moving step by step we will save the entire world from the Jews. I canâ€™t know how can you play, eat and drink and AL-Aqsa in dangerous. You are happy in your home around your family and in this moment there are more people crying and around the rocket and filberts . Every one of them try to save his family and found a peaceful place and you watch TV or go to club or â€¦. Al-Aqsa Mosque is in our hands now but we donâ€™t know what will happen after this time so we must move now to do any thing will save the Aqsa from the cursed and retarded Jews who claim that Al-Aqua mosque for them. They know that they are liar and impostor. Finally, I donâ€™t tell every thing in my heart. I have more and more to say but not saying will enough. we must say and do in the same time. I hope from all people to do any thing they can do and put their selves in Palestine. And if Palestine is your country and all these events happen in it what will you do to save it from Jews."

Arabic,"Diagnosed of being easily impressed Today, I was reviewing my previous entries and my comments. I realized that I'm that kind of people who are easily impressed. I find lots of things fascinating. I'm moved by very simple things and other people might not even have a second look at. For instance, I started watching Indian movies about a month ago. I have some friends who are crazy about this genre. I, on the other hand, didn't have much time to watch any. When I had the time, I brought about six Indian movies to watch. The first movie I watched, made me cry for two hours like a five year old who lost her doll. You think the second one was different? Not at all. The six movies have the same basic idea. Actually all the Indian movies have the same basic idea. However, I continued crying during the rest five and each one of them impressed me even more. Indian movies are like clay that you can shape into many different shapes but they're all still made of clay. The shape is what impresses me, and not the clay itself. This concept might be a bit ambiguous for those who haven't been in such situation. So, how bad is it?"

Arabic,"This is my translation from Arabic to English,, but I really want your help :) There were two friends were walking in a desert. During the trip, they argued and one of them bunched the other friend on his face. The beaten man really got hurt, but without saying a ward, he wrote on the sand: (Today, my best friend hit me on my face). The two friends kept walking until they found an oasis and decided to take a bath. The beaten man's leg stucked in the moving sand and he started sinking. His friend catched him and saved him. After he delivered from death, he wrote on a rock: (Today, my friend saved my life) The one who beated his friend and saved him from death asked him: ""Why when I hit you, you wrote on the sand. But when I rescued you, you wrote on a rock?"" He answered: ""When anybody hurts you, you should write on the sand, so the wind of forgiveness will erase the pain. But when anyone does a favor for your sake, you have to write what that person does on rocks, so no wind can erase that favor. -Learn to write your pains on sand and sculpture the favors on rocks."

Arabic,"My big problem with English. I think that I'm good in some English skills. When I read something, I can understand it. I can use the writing chat in speaking English with friends. But the big problem is with SPEAKING!! When I think about sentence in my mind,I form and say it correctly. But when I say it loud voice,it be so bad, as I just a beginner. I don't know what I must do to improve my speaking?!! Here in Saudi Arabia, all people speak Arabic. Even the foreigners whom came from Pakistan,India, Indonesia..., to work here. They speak a weak Arabic with us. So,I can't practice with anyone. In my English class,my teacher advised us to try speaking English everywhere. She said, even the foreigners talk with you in Arabic, ask them to talk in English. My teacher sometimes, ask two students to ask each others about anything in English language. It is very easy. But I feel shy and don't raise my hand to share them. I'm really don't know why I do that. In fact, some students have a bad English, but they active and want to share the others. I think that my English is quite better than them, so why don't I speak?!! I need some encourage. Pleas, if you have any advises, help me."
Arabic,"My father and me. No doubt that a father is considered as the source of affection and protection for his children. Beside that, he is the breadwinner of the family. For me, my father is only a source of money. When I was a child, I used to see my friends kissing and hugging their fathers infront of me. At the beginning, it was an ordinary thing, but after I grew up, I felt that I have missed a great something which is my father`s affection, I realized that I didn`t take anything from my father except for his money. In addition, I realized that we not only need money to live, but we need love and affection as well. After my mother`s death I thought that my father would change to the better and he would play my mother`s role but unfortunatly he couldnot do that. I am hardly trying to live until I find the one who will make me up. Inspite of that, I love my father so much but, if I had had the capacity to choose my father, I wouldn`t have choosen him. Finally, to each father, please! be a real, good, and kind father, give your children the love they need and the protection they want. Don`t spend most of your time working becaue you believe that your children need money, of course they do, but be aware that they need love before anything else."
Arabic,"Western Words From The East. Dr. sigrid Hunke is the germany author. She wrote a very great book named -in germany - ""Allahs Sonne Ã¼ber dem Abendland"".

She said in it there are a western words came from the arabic language like Sofa , Saffron , Alcohol , Alchemia , Algebra , Giraffe , Henna , Jasmin , Lemon , Sugar , Spinach , Gazelle , Camellia and Kebab. But how we can be sure of these informations? I think if we use Google translator we be sure In the first, translate the English words to Arabic. In the second, click on the symbol to read voice. If you experiance that, tell me about results. Some of these words change when they moved like Suger we pronounce it Sukkar. Lemon we pronounce it Laymoon.

Arabic,"Addicted To Lang-8 I'm now officially addicted to Lang-8. I check it thousand times a day. Logging in Lang-8 is the first thing I do in the morning. I check new corrections for my entries and new Arabic entries needing corrections, if there were any. I usually write an entry everyday, but sometimes, I can't think of anything to write about. So, I just keep the web page open, and stare at it waiting for inspiration. It does come, sometimes. A few years ago, I asked one of my friends about a website where I can find some good non-Egyptians. I wanted to come out of the shell and start knowing about people from other countries, and how they think. She had no suggestions. And now, when I found this website, I said, ""This is what I'm looking for. A website that encourages exchanging cultures, thoughts and making some good friends."" The people here are extremely nice, patient and helpful. The only thing that I don't like is that the Arabic learners is being a bit lazy ,lately. Every other language is getting like tons of entries every couple of minutes, but the Arabic section is so extinct. I wish if the Arabic learners become more active. Finally, I want to thank the geniuses who made this website. And special thank you to everyone who helped me with their corrections, or encouraged me with a nice comment. I really appreciate it all. Best website and best people!"
Arabic,"culture Diversity When I browse the site lang-8 I find a lot of people form many nationality. I think it is a good chance to all members to gain information that relate to those countries. In this era, which called small village, still lack in knowledge of traditional of peoples. If we have a good knowledge about others nation we can make better communication and overcome a lot of obstacles that created hatred in the world."
Arabic,"The festival of Muslims This is my first time I am writing here in Lang-8. I don't know what I want to write about, finely I decide great subject to write bout it. I would like to write about (Ead). I think a lot of people know what is (Ead) mean. It is a big festival for all Muslims although what are their nationalities. All Muslims celebrat in (Ead) because Ramadan is finished. It is just for Muslims people.(Ead) is just 3 days and Muslims can not fast in this 3 days because it is not aloud in Islam. Muslims visit each other and say (salam alikm) mean hi for their family and friends. In the culture of Kuwait the old people in the family give for the young people money to make them happy. Sometime I hope to return 10 years before because I want my family give me a lots of money. All Muslims like this 3 days, also I love it ."
Arabic,"Analyze This, Analyze That It was about four years ago -- or maybe more, I'm not sure -- when I started having these symptoms. I consulted a friend of mine and found that she had the same symptoms. It seemed a bit scary at that time, and maybe I still feel the same way about it. I'm not going to keep you waiting any longer. The problem was that I was always tempted to analyze anything and everything. I know, it seems very ridiculous. I just found it amusing to think about reasons and analyzing things and coming to satisfying conclusions (which were rarely met). I could watch a bird or an ant and observe it's every move, then imagine the reason for doing each of these moves or a some kind of scenario like a movie. Unfortunately, I don't know how to use this precious gift in solving my academic problems quickly. I mean, I could stare at a code for hours and still don't have the slightest idea of how to solve the problem. So, this only works with the surroundings in practical life. You know, one benefit of it is that during the ""light"" traffic in the morning -- that's why it takes me and hour to get to college while I could get there in 15 minutes if it wasn't for that ""light"" traffic -- I could look out of the window and just analyze the things in the street until I get there. And believe me, if you're in Egypt, then you will find lots and lots of things in the Egyptian street that you can analyze. I'd better not get started about this traffic thing because if I did, no one will be able to stop me. Those who had been to Egypt will know exactly what I mean."
Arabic,"know yourself Someone asked me,how can I live compatible with myself? it is really so difficult to answer it due to its answer relate to the nature of human himself. So I gave him a broad lines that can help him to live at least comfortable with himself. The harder thing in this matter is how you know yourself. A lot of people, they don't know what they want to achieve for their selves. We always try to discover a world to knowledge many things around us but we forget to discover ourselves. To live compatible with yourself that mean you must know what you want and what you need. And you must have values and principles that give you a feature humanitarian. Sometimes we try to forsake and abandon our values to gain something but this deed damage ourselves ."

Arabic,"From A Son To His Father One day, the father came home late from work. And as usual he was so exhausted. He found his son waiting for him at the door. ""Dad, can I ask you a question?"" The son said. ""Sure, go ahead,"" the father replied. ""How much do you earn in one hour, dad?"" the boy asked while staring at his father. ""This is non of your business. Why are you asking such a silly question?"" The father said sternly. ""I just want to know. Dad please, tell me how much you earn in an hour?"" the boy begged. ""If you insist, I get 30 dollars per hour,"" the father said rather impatiently. ""Dad, could you lend me 10 dollars,"" he said politely. ""So you wanted to know how much I earned, so you can have 10 dollars and spend it on your silly dolls. Go to your room and sleep. I have been having a hard time in work, and I don't have time for this nonsense."" The father shouted. The boy didn't say a word and he went up to his room, immediately. After a little while, the father felt that he had been hard on his boy, and maybe he really needed the 10 dollars. So, he followed him to his room. And when he opened the door, he said, ""Are you asleep?"" ""No dad I'm awake,"" the boy said in a low voice. ""I'm sorry that I had been hard on you,"" the father said shamefully. "" I just had a long, bad day today. Here is the 10 dollars that you wanted."" His son became very happy. For the father's surprise, the boy pulledÂ some money from under his pillow and put it with the 10 dollars that he had just got. The father became furious, ""Why did you ask for money, if you already have some!"" He asked. ""I didn't have enough money, but now I have 30 dollars. Can I buy an hour of your time to spend together?!"" The boy asked innocently. Now, I don't know if this story is true or not, but I bet that many parents know so little about their children. I have noticed that many people use nannies, which soon becomes a replacement of parents, whether they believed it or not. In Egypt, we don't have this nanny thing at all, at least, nothing that I can tell. But, I've seen some American movies, not very much, but enough to know that nannies are widely used. I mean, are they sure that they want their child to be raised by a nanny, god knows who she is or what she is going to teach their child? Children are like cameras that capture everything that happens around them. Every incident -- no matter how small it is -- will build something in the child's personality. They need special care and attention which they can never get from a nanny. The child needs protection, not only to keep them physically safe, but also keep them from gaining bad attitude. Along with protection, they need affection which can never be given to them by any nanny in the world but their mother. I seriously don't know how these mothers bear to leave their children with someone they don't know, but they must have got a strong heart to do that!"
Arabic,"three ministers Beautiful and wonderful story One day the king summoned his three ministers. He asked each minister to take the bag and go to the palace garden and fills the bag with the good things from various fruits and crops. Also he asked them not to seek the help of anyone in this task and not make another person do this task. The three ministers surprised from the request of the King and each one of them take his bag and go to garden. first minister keen to satisfy the king. He gathered all the best fruits and finest crops. Also he selected the good and nice fruit till he was filling up the bag. The second minister was convinced that the king does not want the fruit, he does not need them for himself and he wouldn't examine the fruit. Because all of these the minster collected the fruits with negligence and he didn't investigate the good from the bad from fruit till he was filling up the bag as they are agreed. The third minister did not believe that the King will be interested in the content of the bag so he already filled the bag with grasses, herbs and leaves of trees. The next day the king ordered to bring the ministers with their three bags which they collected. When the ministers met the king, the king ordered the soldiers to take the three ministers and imprison each one of them separately with his bag which he collected for three months in remote prison and no one can reach to them. Also the king was ordered to prevent eating and drinking for them. The first minister still eats from the good fruit which he collected until the three months have elapsed. The second minister had lived three months in a tight and lack of power, relying on the good fruit which he collected. The third minister died from hunger before the end the first month. Ask yourself from any type are you? You are now in the garden of the world. You are free to combine the good works or malicious actions, but tomorrow when The king of kings order to be incarcerated in your grave alone at this dark and narrow prison. What do you think will benefit you other than the good works which you collected in your world? Summary: Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Always be on the pool of good works on the ground to comfort in end with things which your hand collected in life. Because later remorse does not benefit"
Arabic,"Don't talk to strangers !! Like most kids I was always told ""don't talk to strangers"" WHY? My parents never gave me particularly relevant details on this issue. It is one rule that almost everyone learns as a child. But I filled in my own blanks from stories other kids told me about alien kidnappings, goblins, kidsâ€™ slavery, and three crazy ladies who would lock you in a basement... (Kidsâ€™ Imaginations). We all know it's a big bad world out there. Every day the newspapers are filled with toxic stories of killing, and abusing. Parents worry about letting their children out of their sight. But you can't always protect your children from every possible danger. Another point that parents should keep in mind is that children do not necessarily have to leave their homes to be mistreated. But when you get older, being able to draw near someone you donâ€™t know and start a conversation becomes a good skill to have. Talking to strangers makes you a social, outgoing person, may be friendly; but some adults still donâ€™t like the idea of talking to strangers (I am one of them). If you arenâ€™t in the mood to talk, it can be annoying if a stranger comes up to you and tries start a conversation with you . sometimes can be very awkward. Well I am sort of â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..(can anyone out there help me find out the right word ? ). When I am on a plane or the bus or whatever, I do not want people to talk to me. I just have my book, and I just want to be left alone, and, you know, sometimes itâ€™s not true but for the most part, I still follow the rule of donâ€™t talk to strangers.(I know itâ€™s hard to believe )"
Arabic,"Favorite music Generally, when you are asked to present yourself, they ask you what's your favorite color, favorite music, favorite food (plate).. I have a difficulty to cite just one type of music or one color! I just love things when they are mixed and various. I have favorite color, but I think it became hideous if I wear every things in one color, and the color that I like on my cloths, I don't like it for wall paint. So when I subscribe on a website, I don't fill those case that define my favorite music or anything else. But one of my friends told me once that I have to had a favorite music or a favorite song, and gave me a long lecture on how a person know his ""favorite"" song. I tried to do so, and I listened to some songs that I like. And decided that my favorite is a Zucchero song : cosi celeste. First it's in Italian; and I love Italian, I think it's a very beautiful language. It's a have a rock beats, and I like that kind of rock music the three voices are : a rock voice (Zucchero)which make any song good. an Algerian voice :)), and Mami voice I think is exceptional and a black voice! Here is the song, I hope you like it. I like it, I'm not sure if I should say is my favorite thought :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIXHFBX6TZw&feature=related"
Arabic,"the last episod was so sad!! Hey! I've just watched a sad episod of a korean serie so I feel very sad now. I'm sorry that the main personage has died. I don't like sadness, that's why I prefer funny movies because they have usually a happy end (: and they make me laugh out load so I forget all possible sorrows, but sometimes they are just ridiculous and that makes me angry!!

Arabic,"Epitome of Cool Sometimes, When I get back from college, I feel that I can do absolutely nothing but watching a movie. I feel so exhausted but I cannot sleep because If I slept then when I wake up, I'll have to start studying again or going to college. Watching a movie is like the fun pause between two busy periods. Yesterday, I watched a movie called The Expendables. It's an action movie. It didn't wow me really, not like Inception anyway, because its story wasn't strong or strange enough. It was very plain and straight forward. The ending was great, though. Jason Statham recited a piece of poetry that made it a funny ending. There is only one line I didn't understand. What is the ""Epidemy of Cool""? Here is ending. Enjoy! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkLxp9CwyUQ"

Arabic,"European languages I always thought of European languages as two groups; Latin (for the southern countries) and Germanic (for northern countries). English has common roots with both Latin and Germanic, or at least thats what I think! However, what is making me thinking now, is the Greek. After seeing an entry in Greek I thought the Greek is very different from Latin languages! though Greece is a mediterranean country, and there was many similitude between Roman and Greek! Of course, there are other European languages that are neither Latin nor Germanic, like Irish (or celtic), Russian, ... But for the Greek I can't understand why is it so different from Latin!"

Arabic,"Silent greatness I'm a very big fan of Bruce Lee. He was brilliant and creative. He was hard headed and hard working. Always fighting to be the best. Still, what I highly appreciate in him is his pride. He was very proud. Not that pride that pushes you to show off. No. It is that pride that pushes you to believe in yourself since you are on the right path. That pride that makes you go ahead merely for there are no reasons to stop. I'm talking about that pure pride that raises you to freedom. That pride that pushes a tree to stand tall in all types of weather. I'm talking about that respectful pride, because not all the proud are respectful."

Arabic,"Phobias Phobias are not just extreme fears. they are irrational fears. They can affect on people live and make them frightened to do things which most people do without thinking . for example, if you have a fear of heights, you may derive 50 km to avoid a high bridge. I have a phobia from mouse. I can't stand to see a mouse running near to me. When I see a mouse I cry for half hour approximately. One day my friends saw me cry from mouse they laughed from my reaction when I saw the mouse. My family also laughed on me when I see a mouse. I don't know why they don't know what happen to me in this moment. I feel that the mouse will kill me or do a dangerous thing to me. I try to be more quite when I see a mouse but till this moment I can't. But I still try. There are more types from phobia. The most popular type is exams phobia I think that. It doesn't matter how clever you are or how hard you work, you have probably felt worried before an exam at some time in the past. experts believe that about 50 percent of all students suffer from exam phobia. some people are so frightened of an exam they are going to take that they can't remember information when they are in the exam room. These students will probably get lower marks. Some students cannot even go into the exam room, and of course, the fail. Exams are extremely important for all students . they afraid of failing, because if they fail they will not find a good job. Also, students don't want to disappoint their parents. So what can they do if they suffer from exam phobia? i will write about treatments for phobias but firstly I will read about it. There are different reasons for this phobia."

The following week the child learn how he can control his anger and the number of nails which he knocked daily became decline. He discovered that controlling in him self is easier than knocking the nails in the fence. Finally, the day came when the boy didnâ€™t knock a nail in the fence then he went to his father to tell him that he had no longer need to knock a nail. His father said to him â€œnow, remove one nail for each day passing without losing your temper.â€ After several days, the child told his father that he pulled off all the nails from the fence. The father took his son to the fence and said to him â€œwell done my son but look at the holes which the nails left in the fence, the fence will never return again as it was.â€ Finally, When you argument or disagreement with the other and you got out some bad words, you leave them with a big hurt in their hearts such as the holes which you see in this story. You can stab a person then withdraw the knife from his throat but after you have left the trace of an open wound. So this doesnâ€™t matter how many times you regretted to him because the wound is till there. Wounded of tongue is stronger than the wounded of body."

Arabic,"Bad Friends ^ ^ by Claire Seeber Bad Friends is an absorbing suspense novel that will keep you wondering what might happen up until the very last few pages. The plot is about a 30-year-old TV producer Maggie Warren is involved in a tragic coach crash,However, the crash affected her memory and she only has flimsy flashbacks of what happened before the accident. She also cannot recall why she split up with the love of her life, Alex, nor the reason why her boss is blackmailing her,and yet a young woman called Fay turns up claiming that Maggie saved her life,which she doesn't recognise at all. Things started to go wrong for Maggie when she starts getting anonymous phone calls and texts, her personal things go missing, grafitti is sprayed all over her flat and she keep receiving bouquets of lilies â€“ with messages of condolences. When I started reading this book, the plot felt a little too busy and complex, but on reflection, all of the strands were necessary in order to build the tension. The pace and suspense build well so that by the end you are well and truly hooked. ;) What I did like about this book was the growth of Maggie, from someone I really disliked to someone I could feel empathy for. I went from thinking she was a skin-deep,self-absorbed and completely bored ,to really thinking she had had a rough ride and rooting for her. Bad Friends is a pretty easy-peasy read. At just under 400 pages. so read it and enjoy ...... happy reading"

After he survived, he went to a rock and carved on it: ""Today, my best friend saved me."" His friend was surprised by his actions, so he asked him: ""Why did you write on sand in the first time when I slapped you and now when I saved you, you're writing on stone?"" ""When someone hurt us, we write what they do on sand so the wind of forgiveness would sweep it away. But when someone do us a favour, we must write it on stone so no wind would erase it,"" the one who got slapped answered. So try to write your pains on sand and curve the favours on stone."

Arabic,"A nother time and a nother place. Yesterday, I imagined myself at a nother time and in a nother place so, I was very happy. Therefore, If I had the capacity to change my time and my place, I would like to live in Makka at the time of the prophet ""Mohamed"". It was a great time which was full of love, tolerance and power, at this time you can easily find the features of the perfect model who anyone wants to follow. ATthis time I found that everyone loved the other for the sake of love not for the sake of anything else, everyone was ready to sacrifice himself to remain the other alive and safe. In addition,poeple worked together to achieve many progresses to make their country more advanced. When I choosed this time and this place specificly I choosed them because there was a leader who ruled the poeple by justice and love. This leader is the prophet"" Mohamed""who had a message for those poeple to deliver. He was trying all the time to abolish slavery trade and set the slavers free. and he spread peace among the poeple. From my point of view ""Prophet Mohamed"" is the most intelligent leader at this time because he saw that if he wanted to build a country he had to establish the poeple first before doing anything else. As a result,his age is in history and his strategies are taught in colleges now. How far he was a great leader and father at the same time and I am so proud of him because he inculcated values and ethics in poeples` minds and souls. Becauce of all of these things I would like to live at this time and just see the peron who changed the world for the better and made us better creatures. Without exaggeration""Mohamed""is the teacher of teachers."
Arabic,"About the flight It was a long time since I went by plane. I think the road trip is more interesting, I enjoy the landscapes, and stops to eat and drink. This time my trip was only for two days, so the plane was the best or only choice. I forgot how the airport can be interesting. A great variety of people, not only from the country but also from around the world! The flight was internal, and yet there were many foreigners. It was funny; one rarely hears an Arabic word or even French! Some speak strange languages I do not know. I only speak French and English, but I can recognize Italian, Spanish, German and Russian. There was a group of people,who took the same flight as me, speaks a language I could not even guess! Then I thought it was probably Norwegian;I know there are Norwegian companies in our region, oil companies. The largest group was an Asian group; it was so big that when they stood at the gate, it was believed that the aircraft was headed towards the Far East. While it was headed towards Oran, a city in western Algeria. There was just some non-Asian on that flight!"

Arabic,"Catch a cold this week, Take an exam next week From the beginning of winter, I've been waiting for the cold to come. To me, whenever the winter comes, catching a cold becomes inevitable. In Egypt, winter has started about a month ago and I was getting really suspicious because I didn't catch anything although all my friends caught everything you can imagine. I was starting to believe that I was under a hex or something. But then, I had a sore throat yesterday (which is my worst nightmare). I thought it was a visit (from a NOT dear old friend) that will take only one day. Today, I realized that this friend decided to continue the journey until the life cycle ends. This visitor love fooling around, I'm telling you. Here is the proof. The life cycle is like this: 1) First day: I have a sore throat. 2) Second day in the morning: A pain in the right ear join in. 3) Second day in the night: My left ear hurts too. 4) Third day: I start talking like Pinocchio, nose problem (believe me, you don't want to know the details). 5) Fourth day: I could act like a vampire (because of the red eyes), a heater (seriously, they don't need to turn on the heater. They just need to set beside me and they'll get loads of heat and catch a cold which well make them self-sufficient because later they'll generate the heat by themselves) or I could simply play dead (which is the easiest and the least painful one of them all). See what I'm talking about. This is my annual excruciating visit that I have to live with. It's okay to catch cold, it was expected anyway, but the problem is that my final exams are next week. Perfect timing, right? All right, I'm going to lead myself out of this website right now before anyone gets infected with the virus or an unpleasant visit from you-know-who."
Arabic,"The Egyptian Revolution What happened here in Egypt for the last two weeks is something that will never be forgotten. I've been thinking about which aspect I should write about first. So many things happened in the last 2 weeks so I can only write about abstractions of this incident. It all started on the 25th of January. A week before that day, people sent invitations to others on Facebook asking them to join this demonstration. This demonstration was simply for demanding a decent life for all the Egyptian people that includes: fighting unemployment, eliminating corruption elements in the current system and defining a reasonable salary that satisfies basic needs. The main sign that was held that day was Â¨Freedom... Democracy... Social JusticeÂ¨. There's nothing wrong with that, right?... Wrong! At least that's the government's opinion. The government started suppressing the demonstrators. They started using their one and only tool they have for dealing with any demonstration which is violence. In the night of that day, invitations of making the next Friday 28th of January ""The Day of Anger"". Invitations on Facebook were sent by everyone to everyone. They planned to make it a ""Million March"". They planned to march form everywhere and asking people that look out of balconies and windows to get down and march with them, then they were to meet in Tahrir Square. Also, the bar was raised as they found no response or respect from the government side. People started raising signs that asks for more than just Â¨Freedom... Democracy... Social JusticeÂ¨, they cheered Â¨The people wanted to overthrow the regimeÂ¨. As always, the police followed their traditional method. They tried to stop people from reaching Tahrir Square because all the demonstrators from all the streets tried to reach this square. They thought that Â¨Divide And ConquerÂ¨ will work this time but they underestimated the people's rage. They exhausted everything they have: tear gas, powerful sprinklers of water, rubber bullets and real bullets. They used it all until there was nothing left. Many people died that day, hundreds hurt and hundreds arrested. Around six o'clock, the police in the field received a command to leave the field and save their own lives specially that the army was to get down to the streets and curfew was imposed from 7:00 pm until 8:00 am. That day, was the beginning of the disaster. A disastrous plan was being executed by foreigners (whom we still don't know but the government does) on our land, so here is what happened. All police stations were burnt down, all prisons were bombed and about thirty thousand (30,000) prisoner were let out. All this happened simultaneously (coincidence?! I don't think so). You can't imagine how bad this was. Large hypermarkets and Malls were robbed like Carrefour and others, over twenty-one thousand (21,000) -- or even more -- piece of weapon were stolen and were in the hands of these prisoner. These foreigners went pointing their guns on the face of all civilians, robbing homes, smashing every shop they encounter in the way, attacking the Egyptian Museum, crashing ATM's and steeling money from it. Can you imagine how dangerous this was? But then came back the Egyptian spirit that was long lost in this modern world. The simple Egyptian people really saved the day. I'll tell you how this happened in my next journal because I think no one will have the patience to read all this in one time. I'm sorry that this journal was not a happy one but I promise next one will be much better. By the way, thanks to all my friends who missed me during this time. You're the best friends I could have :)"

Arabic,"Ancient Navigation In The Arabian Gulf Since ancient, the Arabian Gulf has been very important to the Arabian Gulf countries. That because two thirds of its coasts are Arabian coasts. In the past they have depended much in this gulf in fishing, diving for pearls and in trading. So, it was one of the main pillars of their economic. Sailors used their simple boats to go fishing and diving. The equipments they used in diving and looking for pearls were very simple. About trading, they have exported some of their products such as, dates, grapes, wool, gum Arabic and gems to Indonesia, China and other far east countries. They have imported spices, perfumes and leathers from those countries. Their trading also has reached the east and the south of Africa. They have imported gold, perfumes and spices from there. Some of the problems and dangers they had are: sharks, harmful creatures. Plus, some skin and respiratory diseases because of diving. Now, in the presence of petrol in most of the Arabian Gulf countries those old professions naturally are not as important as they were before. ---------- What is the verb from "" ablution"" ??"
Arabic,"Funny But Useful There were three men who travelled abroad for some reason. They couldn't find any good place to live in except for only one apartment in the twenty-seventh floor in a hotel. The receptionist there told them that the elevator closed it's doors automatically at 10 pm. So they had to be there before that time. If the elevator was closed, then it can't be opened until the next morning because the control room was very far from that building. In the first day, they went out and came back before it was 10. But in the next day, they came back running but it was 10:05 pm. The elevator was already shut five minutes ago. They almost cried, but it was all in vain. They decided to take the stairs instead. ""Let's have each one of us tell a story for 25 floors until we get to our room, so we wouldn't feel so tired,"" one of them suggested. The others liked the idea. So they started their journey to the top. The first man said, ""I'll tell you a bunch of jokes and funny stories that's going to make your stomach ache from laughing."" And so he told them every joke he had in mind. They were laughing like crazy. The whole building was vibrating because of their laughter. Then it was the second man's turn. ""I'll tell you about a more serious stories,"" he said. He kept telling serious stories until the end of the second 25 floors. And then there was the third man who told them that they have heard jokes and serious stories, but the stories he was going to tell, would be very sad, miserable and grief stories. So he told them the most dreadful stories any one could ever hear. Then they finally arrived at the 75th floor, when a horrible fact hit them THEY HAD FORGOTTEN THE KEY OF THE ROOM WITH THE RECEPTIONIST! The receptionist was in the ground floor. When they realized this fact, they all fainted. The human life is mostly similar to this story. In the first 25 years, one tend to have fun, mess around and do fool things. They do not do anything useful in these best 25 years of their lives. While in the next 25 years, one get married, have kids of their own and be busy trying to make a living for their families until they reach the age of 50. In the last 25 years, the misery starts: one get sick, move between hospitals, spend money on medicines, divorce this, marry that, have problems between sons and their wives which requires fathers interference and debts accumulated which they borrowed for making their families happy, so neither they nor their families could be happy. Then death comes, and one wish to go back to the first 25 years. One should make sure that they always see the whole video tape of their lives running in front of their eyes, and have a goal to assess their behaviour. So when they deviate from the road which leads to their goal, they would find something that urges them to come back on the right track. I hope that this story would be helpful to others."

Do you know that make someone feel smile it's called a charity, and it's written in your good deeds. I love making jokes.

For example, I remember my sister was going to school when she was walking through the street, a dog was running and he saw my sister and then he started chasing her, My sister doesn't like dogs she get afraid from them. She was cursing the dog by saying"" Dog, you are an animal""' We know that he is an animal-. This is one of the silly memories that I remember. Fine if I make you smile."
Arabic,"A Scary Fact About Learning Spanish Today, I read an article about how to learn Spanish. I was searching for a bit of motivation. Unfortunately, I found the exact opposite. It is true though. I've always believed in the fact that he stated, I just ignored it. What he said goes like this: ""Motivation for learning Spanish. Is this for you, or someone else? Your reason for learning has to be at least three years strong. To become conversational you need to recognize that you are embarking on a life long journey that needs at least three years to get off of its feet."" Right now, my doubts are speaking loud and I'm questioning again whether I should go on with this. So far, I don't have any good reason for learning Spanish. I genuinely think that motivation is built based upon a solid ground which is constructed by a feasible and real reason. What do you I should do?

Arabic,"Things in Life we can't change .. Is there something we can't change ? Can we change every thing in our life? I don't know how these questions came to my mind, well I was reading a personal development book, while I was reading I just realized how many things in my life should be organized and changed, and I was wondering if there are some things are parts of me and I can't change. My question now is more general I'm thinking of things people can't change whatever they do, work, or study, something they must live with it with no hope to change it. Things can be changeable or unchangeable, somethings are easy to change, others not but still changeable, people always change things they feel uncomfortable with, hard to live with, or they dream to be, people live their life and work hard to make the change they want to see in their own life, their families life, or in their society. Thinking from simple things to hard things, we can change many things more than we expected we can change bad habits, educational level, our names, nationalities, how we look, our religion, other people, gender ... Thinking of thing we can't change is more difficult because when you think of something unchangeable you just find a way make it changeable even if this way is't easy, or maybe this thing can be changeable in the future, so I couldn't find many things, for example we can't change our genes, destiny, parents .. hmmm what else ? ~~~~~ This was a self talking I didn't find anything to write so I share these thoughts ( ^_^')"

Arabic,"A Tourism Journey in Makkah - part 1 Two weeks ago, my aunt arranged for such a tourism journey to Makkah in order to visit and increase our knowledge about the famous landmarks there, and the sacred places Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø´Ø§Ø¹Ø± Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù‚Ø¯Ø³Ø© each Muslim has to go to when performing Hajj (pilgrimage). My aunt hired a bus with its driver. Beside us, she invited my cousins and my other aunts. We were all 14, and we were women only. Makkah is only 78 Km from here â€“Jeddah. That takes about an hour by car. In the bus, and in our way to Makkah, mommy and my aunt were examining our knowledgeability about the places we are going to. We reached Makkah around sundown. So, we prayed maghrib prayer (evening prayer) at the Holy Mosque. Then we visited the Exhibition of the Two Holy Mosques Architecture . There were many amazing and rare real exhibited articles taking from the Two Holy Mosques throughout history. I think I took pictures to nearly everything in the exhibition. I tried to stop capturing photos, but each time I find a wonderful thing that I can't pass by without taking a photo to. This was our first day in the journey ^^ Now to some photos: **All the photos in this report and the coming ones are from my camera, except those signed with stars. http://www.iimmgg.com/image/67fcd6826dd4e0ce1504284504523891 http://www.iimmgg.com/image/985ef4e8bc68a394d510d23fe238de3b On our way to Makkah http://www.iimmgg.com/image/9c31ed02b82b1b01dd5f9430bf6dc8b6 A sign tells it's the beginning of the sacred area boundary. http://www.iimmgg.com/image/c94587122b1e71c2e260c1421b6906d6 Makkah Clock Tower. http://www.iimmgg.com/image/167306a069c4582225c2902c44ffdc85 A side of The Holy Mosque. http://www.gph.gov.sa/attach/files/2011%5C04/ma3radh00.jpg Front view of the Two Holy Mosques Exhibition.** http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4090/5046961810_74f25403dc.jpg A teak staircase of the Holy Ka'aba dating back to 1240 H. ** {We're now in the year 1432 according to the Islamic(Hijri) calendar} http://www.iimmgg.com/image/8b5f1efaf782ae17b24a63ae82e14c70 The curtain of the door of the ka'aba.

Arabic,"In the USA, Bigotry Is Served With the Coffee To Muslims Only ""Bigotry is served with the coffee,"" is what the man in the show said, not me. This is a series on abc news which is called ""what would you do?"". They have some hidden cameras that reveals the truth. So, people are tapped in their most real behaviour. In this episode, they were running an experiment to see how people would react when Muslims are around them. Honestly, this episode has revealed a lot to me. It showed a diversity of reactions from American people. You'll see all kinds of people: from bigots to the most sympathetic people. Some people were moved to tears for seeing such discrimination towards the Muslim woman. Hats off for these people. The respect I have for these people is not because they were defending the Muslim woman, but because they understand what justice really is; they chose to step in and say the truth no matter what other people would think about them. Watch the whole video and you'll see the statistics the scares the MuslimsÂ who are living in the USA. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R-QKDCCJM0"

Arabic,"""Youngsters"" vs. ""Young People"" vs. ""Youth"" vs. ""Teenager"" vs. ""Immature Person"" I guess the long title says it all! Maybe the age limits are not fixed except for ""Teenager."" ""Immature"" is probably a state of mind as being not developed regardless of age. If I would complement a 40-year old lady I would say ""You look like a young girl."" And she might say ""Well, I am a young girl!"" If this lady wants to recall her old days, would she say ""As a youngster,"" or ""When I was a young girl""? Well, take what I said as brain storming and let me know what these words mean to you."

Arabic,"Good Bye Lang-8 It's really hard to say good bye to something I've been addicted to over four months now. I used to write an English entry every night. But, unfortunately, I can't do this any more. We're being showered with dozens of assignments, quizes and projects, let along mid-term exams starting next week. I can't keep track of it all. Things got mixed up, deadlines are missed and assignments are delivered incomplete, so I need to take actions. I need to make sacrifices. I wouldn't keep away one day from Lang-8 if I had a choice, but there isn't really much options left. I take six courses; three of which, I have no idea what they are talking about. So yes, it's that bad. I'm not going to abandon the website completely. Practically, I can't do that, because I've set it to be my homepage. So, I'll be checking it once in a while. And of course, any of the Arabic learners can send me questions in messages and I'll gladly answer them all. I'll also be checking the new Arabic entries to see if someone needs help. But, I won't be writing any entries for the next two weeks. It's not like I've been waiting to write about some brilliant and impressive topics. This might actually work for my favour as it'll give me some time to think about some good topics. I'm not sure if I have the time for that but I'll try to find it somewhere. See you in two weeks!"

Arabic,"Questions is gate of happiness I always ask myself about happiness, how can all people attain peace with their selves without any suffering? I think, every deed we do it is so as to gain tranquility or happiness but why sometimes lost happiness. We should ask ourselves, what is the source of happiness? Is the source of happiness material or incorporeal? Is it absolute thing or relativism? How could we know we are living in happiness? Questions give us more opportunity to discover truth and to be able resolve many things that disturb our goal. If we give ourselves a chance to ask and answer on it, that mean we experience a human behavior. The short way to be compatible with the life, people, and ourselves is how to put question and answer it. I hope to read your comment. thanks"

Arabic,"Rock In the Middle Of the Road Once upon a time, a king had put a big stone in th middle of one of the main roads in his kindoms. Then, he disappeared behind one of the bushes. He kept watching people's reactions to the rock which was placed in a very awkward spot. The wealthy people walking down the street saw this stone, looked in amazement at it, walked around it and continued going on their way. Some other people saw it and started talking about negligence of the people in charge, and that the king isn't doing his job by checking on those things. Finally, a farmer who was coming back from his field, going home, carrying basket full of fruit on his shoulders saw this stone. He quickly put his basket aside, pulled up his sleeves and with all his strength, he started lifting the big stone all by himself. He managed to put it at one side of the road. When he bent to pick his basket back up, he found a bag put in the spot where the stone was, in the middle of the street. He picked it up and found that it was full of gold, a note was also attached to it. The note said, ""This gold belongs to whoever takes the stone off the road."" So, the poor farmer earned the kings gold, and also, learned a lesson, that whatever obstacles one encounter in life, these obstacles must give them something new which will turn them into a better person."
Arabic,"Antigone. Antigone is a play written by Sophocles in the Greek times, and it is related to Oedipus`s legend. It is meant to raise the difference between human law and divine law. The incidents of the play tell about a law that made by Creon -the portagonist of the play-and this law is symbol of the tyrannical authority of him. By this law Creon forbids the burial of one of Antigone`s brothers claiming that he is traitor. Creon forgets that man`s soul couldn`t find rest except when it is buried. Therefore, Antigone-the heroine of the play-tries to bury her brother because she beleives that it is wrong to obey such a law which insults human dignity. She beleives that this law stands against God`s well and rules. She decides yo bury her brother because she convinced that human laws aren`t perfect, and they can be broken at any time when it is necessary. Through out the play we find her facing death just because she beleives in God`s law, when she says""I please whome most I ought to please"" we really understand that she isn`t concerned of pleasing the king as much as she is concerned of pleasing God. Antigone is a tragic hero not because a hamartia but because she leads a life of the tragic heros,she suffers until she buries her brother, and she lives in a conflict like the the tragic heros. If we come to creon, he is the Aristotlian and typical tragic hero. He is a king which means that he is from a high rank but he has an obvious flaw which is his pride. Creon is very hubris and his arrogance blinds his eyes that he is taking the wrong decsion that leads to his tragic end. His pride makes him forget that he stands against God`s well which is the reason of his tragic downfall. In fact, Creon realises that he is mistaken by disobeyind God`s laws but it turns to be too late because he loses all his family members,his neice, his wife, and also his son. To cut a long story short, this play is very crucial because it sheds light on the typical tragic hero who is Creon, on the other hand it tells us that no one, and no law can exceed GOD`S laws. This play tells us be brave and do what you find it right, don`t follow the others if they are wrong. Don`t say that I am alone or I am not enough to change. Be sure that the slightest thing you do can make a change."

Arabic,"Living in a dormitory. A survey made by some students studying at a college in Cairo University proved that about sixty percent of the students prefer to live in a dormitory rather than living at home during college life. They prefer to live in a dormitory because they see that in dormitories they will : have more fun with coleagues, meet new people , have new experiances, and face new challenges. Those student say that living in a dormitory makes one meet new people, and have more fun as one can stay up with the new coleagues playing music or games without caring a bout little siblings or sleeping parents. As well as, studying with dormitory mates makes studying easier as they will share new ideas among eachother. In addition, living in a dormitory forces the student to have new experiances in life, and face a lot of different situations inwhich s/he has to deal with tham wihout help from parents. That`s means that student has to depend on her/himself to lead a proper life. Moreover, one student said when one lives in a place far from his parents, old friends, familial relations,and heighbourhood, s/he begins having new challenges. For example, one tries to prove for the others ,especially parents, that s/he can take the responsibility, and s/he is up to it,and this in itself a big and difficult challenge. Based on this, students prefer to live in a dormitory because they want to learn more from life without the direct help of their parents, they want to lead their college life on their own, and they want to be independent."
Arabic,"My lovely life Hi every one today I am going to talk about my life in New Zealand and my previous life in Saudi Arabia so let talk one by one. In Saudi Arabia I was studying at a university over there for one year, and I stopped so my plane was to come to New Zealand, and to learn a little bit of English language and improve it so quickly, because my major was English so at that time I had decided to come here before. I came here I asked one of my friends which he has been here for a long time. I told him that I will probably come to New Zealand so what do you think is a good idea, because it that time I was little bit worried. He had told me that just come here and do not worry about anything and I am sure you would love it he says. Exactly, I had left my lovely university and I came here while I was living here I had changed my mind to continue my study here, so I have done it and now I am still studying here but I have should gone to the USA, but I did not that the thing I will regret about in whole my life is the reason why, because over there the study there much easier than here so. I feel really regretted whoever it is amazing country, and so nice people and helpful as well so I have had found good things and bad things, but this is u would find them all over the world so it does not matter for me.

Arabic,"When Things Go Wrong When things go wrong, and don't work according to one's plan. When one can' t achieve a required change, they need to change the strategy of their work. Here is a story that shows how to deal with such issues. A blind man was sitting in the street with his hat in front of him, and a sign was put next to him that said, ""I'm blind, please help me!"" A man who worked in advertisement saw that there were few cents in the hat. So he put some more. And without the blind man's permission, he took the sign and wrote another advertisement on it. When he was finished, he put the sign at the blind man's leg and walked away. At the end of the day, the advertisement man passed again near the blind man. The blind man could tell that it was him from his steps. The advertisement man noticed that the hat was full of coins and cash. The blind asked him if he rewrote the sign, and what he wrote exactly. ""Nothing but the truth,"" he answered. Then, he smiled and went on his way. What was written on the sign is: ""We are in the spring, but I can't see its beauty."""

In fact I was not intended to read English book yet, I was afraid I can't understand most of it, though I read different articles in English on the Internet, but a literature book would be difficult! When I went to the library looking for some books to buy, I saw some books in English; most of them are Shakespeare's, and no way I would even think to read them! And there was a thin book titled : The importance of being Ernest, by Oscar Wilde, I got my courage and decide to buy it, after all it's a little book so it won't be hard, and I saw the movie and already know the story and that will helps. I start reading it today and almost finish it, and for my big surprise it was really understandably, I didn't had any difficulty, in the contrary it seems easier than other text ( teaching texts) I read, I guess good literature and good use of a language even in a classical way make it more easy, unlike what most people think. Of course I don't think that a Shakespeare's will be that easy, for he use a very ""classic"" English and very tragic, which will make it harder to me, any way I don't like tragic stories! but Wilde is more simple and light, I read his book "" the portray of Dorian Gray"" but the French version, so I think that I like him, and I will look for other writing but it must be as thin as the one I'm reading! :)"
Arabic,"My enemies I will prove to my enemies that Majid does not care about them. My study more important Than their conflicts so I will concentrate on my future. Always my family encourage me to achieve my dreams, but anybody can not be good without effort so I think if we do not have motivation we can not achieve anything."
Arabic,"Friendship That social intimate link between us and others , is called friendship. Friendship has several ways to be expressed out. that depends on people favourite things to do . Somebody likes to spend more time with his friends , a nother one prefers making phonecalls occasionally and so on . These different expressive ways of friendship care are diverse as we can see, but they are not everything in friendship . What does matter also is respect and understanding between friends and then appreciation is definitley is on its way afterwards."
Arabic,"Inception (The movie of the year) I could safely say that this is the best movie I've seen so far. It is absolutely incredible. I'm still not sure how could anyone get an idea like this and turn it into a movie. This movie is actually much more complicated than it seems. I've watched this movie twice to understand the details that I missed in the first time. But even after the second time, I was still confused about the ending. I was not sure whether Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) was stuck in limbo or got back to reality as the movie ended before the totum stops. This was the only point I was confused about until I read an explanation to it that made me find out that we all -- my friends and myself -- got it totally wrong (the whole movie). The explanation was shocking that it made me feel so stupid. I wouldn't have understood it that way, not in a million years. I'm going to share the link of the explanation with you, but please, if you didn't watch the movie yet, don't read the review. Give yourself a chance to understand the movie by yourself which will keep you in some suspense when you read the explanation and find out what was really happening.

Arabic,"wrestling One of the most beautiful frightening sports that is the dearest to my heart is wrestling. I became admitting it since I was 7 years old. The first show that I can remember was displaying on Dubai Channel called "" Fortress "". Fortress has many sorts of sports and was the best level to my heart was the Wrestling part, if you wanna pas this game you have to be skillful and make sure that you should have strength enough, you should know the person who are you going to find. There is a beautiful show also called WWE Experience on space power. I became on of the fans to this show, After I saw an ugly face man was taking down the other wrestler and and gave him the last knockout, he started bleeding and started screaming and pulling the man to move away from him, the arbitrator announced on the death to him, I shocked and said: Is this man a monster? I really just can't believe what does he did? really aggressive. Since then I couldn't stand watching that show and ever since I Flip the channel and see that show , I just Change it without thinking to a good beneficial and peace show."
Arabic,"The Weather in The Eastern Region I lived in the eastern region of my country for around 13 years. Now I live in the western region. The weather there is very hot in summer. And some days there are a very very hot air, as same as you just sit near a stove. Sometimes you can't breath easily because of the humid. It's in the coast of the Arabian Gulf. So, the humid is so much. In winter it's very cold. The temperature gets to 4Â°. And it rains weekly. In my own opinion, the great thing I missed from the eastern region is its winter. I hope I can spend all winters there."
Arabic,"For beginners in Arabic Lately I see a lot of those who are learning Arabic complaining about the ""tachkil"" (don't know if there is name for it in English!). Some think that it makes things very difficult, others can't understand them! So I have to explain what ""tachkil"" is good for. Originally there was no ""tachkil"" in Arabic neither ""dots"": no dots on the Ù, Ù‚, Ø¨, ÙŠ, Øª, Ø¶, Ø² ... and as you can see there is no way to make the differences between Ø¨, Øª, ÙŠ for example. Still, the Arabs could easily and without any problem recognize them. The Arabic is a very precise language, in a way you can explain exactly what you mean and let no doubt with less words, because every word have a precise meaning, and Arabs was almost obsessed with the language so they was genius in the arts of poetry and words puzzles. After the expansion of Islam, a lot of non-Arabs start learning how to read in Arabic, and that was very difficult, and so Arabs start to make some helpful adds to the letters to preserve the language (because when a non-Arab try to read or translate from Arabic he may make a lot of mistakes due to resemblance of the letters and some words that have same spelling but pronounced differently). Now the dots on the letters are indispensable, and you can see letters without dots only in antique documents, in another hand ""tachkil"" is just to help beginners and once they get familiar with the language and learned the basic rules they don't need'em any more, and as I said before; it's like a third wheel! As for me, I'm a very beginner in English and need correction for this entry :)"
