So tough schedule last week... returned home in Ibaraki, attended a funeral, got back to Kagoshima, headed to the gym I played basketball game so far from my house and played it 3games / 2days. Now at home and chilling with my lovely MacBook Pro :-) I got so tired to push forward with such a tough schedule. Well the result of the games were all win and our team can play in the finals. Now I feel quite relieved because some main members of our team were absent, so we had to play with some young members including me.

Japanese,"diary 8/2 Hi^^ I went to the beach today. I also went swimming a lot. Normally, I would enjoy these things, but I couldn't today. I think it would be fun if we could have done these things together... I miss you so much. We'll be ok though right? I've never done a long distance relationship before, but they're really difficult, aren't they? I hope that even though we are so far away that we will be together forever. I really hope that we will never break up. Because I really really love you. I want to get married to you. So, I'll do my best researching too. I want to do my best for you. I hope that you will be able to be happier starting tomorrow! I'm not good at putting things like this into words, but I think that everyone should try to live positively. I've always felt this way You have to face your problems positively because happiness lies within your own hands, you have the power to create your own happiness. Whether you are happy or not depends on the ways that you solve your problems. If you're feeling tired, you'll be alright after taking a break, don't push yourself too hard--this is important too:) If something bad happens, you first have to accept it to be able to move forward. First look for the cause, then you'll be able to move forward. So let's try being more positive from today:) I love you! This email was sent by Jackie last night. After I read this email, I thought she really did her best to tell her feelings!!! I'm really happy to find her. I will never dislike you. I don't want to say that. I should say I will love you forever. I don't want her to worry about our relationship because I can't love anyone without her. I'm sure Jackie is the best woman for me. I know a long distance relationship is difficult,but we can overcome it!!!!! Both Jackie and I are a natural worrier, but I want to make her not to think about it. I will do my best to make her happy."

Japanese,"PSYCHOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE FOR MEN. I will have to speech in my class room next monday. but I can't think of serious topic so I decide to talk about techniqques for men. There are two types men. Some men are very popular with women,others are not. Of course,These things include our face,money,background and so on. But between popular men and not popular men have a lot of difference. To begin with,I am talking about how to ask girls out. In asking a girl out,It is important to make her imagine concrete date. If you said just""Do you have a time tonight??"" She couldn't imagine date. On the contrary,it makes her have negative image. So you should tell her when the date finishes. Almost women don't actively feel like dating with someone who is not friends with her. Above all, like the date she can't understand when the date finishes. So you had better tell concrete plan her ""do you have a tea time 30 minutes?""when you ask her out. Secondly,It's important to add some reason for the date. If you say just"" I wanna date with you"",a reason of the date is only one which she meets you. If this case , if she accepted the invitation,she would thought a sale of herself. So you must have a valid reawson to make her accept your invitation. By valid reason,she will take up your invitation easily."
Japanese,"The Exercise of Design and Drawing Yesterday I went to the cram school for the study of the exam for becoming a registered architect. In the school we did the exercise of design and drawing of a museum. Those who couldn't finish the exercise within the time limit have to do it at home until next Sunday. I couldn't finish it. So I have to finish it at home. Today, I saw the plan which I drew yesterday. I found that my plan is in breach of the condition of the problem. The problem specifies that a museum shop shall be located near an entrance hall. But in my plan the museum shop isn't located near the entrance hall. Fortunately, I can avoid this breach by making a trade of the location of the museum shop for the location of the toilet near the entrance hall. But I've made the drawing partway. I have to revise my drawing. In other words, there is a regression in my drawing process. I should be careful to read a sentence of a problem before drawing in order to avoid a regression."

So, I try to look back over the past in brief. ãƒ»September I went to see the musical ""Sound of the music""(by Gekidan Siki) with my friend for the first time. Unfortunately,all songs were Japanese. However, Their acting and orchestra's sounds were very good. I had very good timeâ™ª ãƒ»October There weren't any special eventsâ€¦. I practiced to play the trumpet for the group lesson. I practiced ""Feel like makin' love"" then. ãƒ»November I bought an used PS3 to watch Blu-ray disc of GRANRODEO's live. I was crazy about GRANRODEO for this month. Because their live was held at NHK hall on November 23th after an interval of six months. That day was the 5th anniversary year's day from their debut. I was very happy to hear their songs directly after a long time. ãƒ»December On December 18th, my dear Roro's birthdayâ™ªã€€She became 3 years old. I hope she grows up in good health. Except it, There is no special. I studied English and practiced the trumpet. I started to practice ""The Chicken"" from this month. ãƒ»January One week ago, in first trumpet lesson of this year, we got a task from the teacher. It is to compose the part of our own solo.

Japanese,"Memoriziing Words I'm going to have an English test named TOEIC, though most of you might not know this test because it is not as common as TOEFL. As a fact, this lang-8 editor I'm using now seems to detect the character string ""TOEIC"" as an undefined word, but not ""TOEFL"". :D Coming back to having test thing, so I have to study for it now. I know my weak point very well, which is nothing but vocabulary. In Japanese language, it is easy to infer the meaning of unknown words because Kanji (æ¼¢å­—) has meaning itself. On the other hand, it is very hard in English. Especially, the shorter the word is, the harder to infer its meaning. Same thing is memorizing. Memorizing English words is a kind of pain to me. Isn't there any good way to memorize many unknown English words without pain?"
Japanese,"Bald kids - for 3 days I happened to find a deligent learner on this site tonight, who updates her jornal every single day. It made me determnine to write a diary every day even though I can write short sentences. Hope I will continue updating my diary from today. On the other hand, I have a worry that I may give up my mind sooner or later. Here we have a Japanese saying, ""Mikka - Bozu"", calling those who cannot strive to carry on their big plans more than three days. The word 'Mikka' means three days and 'Bozu' means a bald kid. I wonder if there is any expression describing the same meaning in English."
Japanese,"Japanese Kawaii and English Cute Yesterday after I read one of my lang-8 friendsâ€™ journal entry, I thought that I wrote this entry. In the entry she wrote about Japanese word "" kawaii"". I think Japanese ""kawaii"" and English ""cute"" are a bit different. Our kawaii has a lot of meaning. For example, when we look at a ""cute"" dog, we think it is kawaii. The cute meaning and our kawaii meaning are same, I think. On the other hand We use kawaii for guys. For examples, when I listen to my language exchange partners' Japanese phrases, I sometimes think that their Japanese sounds very kawaii. I think when Gaijins speak Kansai accents, it sounds very kawaii for me. When I ate lunch with one of my partner, Mark, he ate a peace of cake with big smiling like kids. I thought he is very kawaii. In fact his behavior is always kawaii for me. Maybe I don't have sons; he and I have a big generation gap. In addition, American people are good at expressing their happy feelings. Therefore, maybe I always think he is kawaii. If I express my kawaii feeling with using ""cute"", I guess that my foreign friends can't understand my feelings. I think kawaii is one of the words which we can't translate into English. Therefore, when I describe kawaii feelings, I always use "" kawaii"" to my language exchange partners. I hope my entry is helpful for your Japanese knowledge."
Japanese,"Ireland Trip - Day 1 & 2 Hi everyone! How was your Thanksgiving holiday? I guess people who live outside of the USA didnâ€™t have many days off. I went Ireland for Thanksgiving as I posted my journal while ago. Thank you so much for all recommendation for this trip! We left Los Angeles in November 26th and arrived at Dublin, Ireland on the 27th. On the first day, we visited Guiness Storehouse. It was very big building and displaying a lot of interesting stuff about their beer. Guiness is celebrating their 250th anniversary this year! On the second day, we were planning to go to the Cliffs of Moher and Ashfort Castle which is both located west side of Ireland. I heard about flood in Ireland from a friend from Lang-8 so I was worried about it. On our way to the Cliffs of Moher some road was flooded and canâ€™t make it thru and needed to take different road to get there. We finally arrived around 4pm there after four or five hours of driving but the sun sets around 4:15pm there we couldnâ€™t see nice view. We couldnâ€™t make it to Ashfort Castle that day and needed to give up on the castle because we have some other stuff to do on the 3rd day and 4th day. I really wanted to see one of the most beautiful castles Ashfort Castle! We headed back to the hotel in Dublin from the Cliffs of Moher and our GPS made us took really tiny road which barely fits one car. It was very foggy even daytime. I havenâ€™t seen such a thick fog before! During the journey we found a few rabbits on the road and they jumped in front of our car. They go forward as we go so we were kind of chasing the rabbits with the car. Our 2nd day didnâ€™t go as we planed but still fun. I will write about 3rd and 4th day on later post."

Japanese,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Use reasons and specific details to support your answer.Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants,and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. I'm for this statement, and smoking should be prohibited as long as possible. Frst of all, smoking is not good for our health. According to the latest study, smoking higher the risk of various illness, say, cancer, heart attack, stroke,and so on. WHO reported that 4.9 million people are killed by the smoking per a year. The smoke contains more than 4000 chemical substances, and a lso more than 50 cancer's resourses. Futhermore passive smoking also causes nonsmoker of lung cancer, the respiratory disease, the sudden death of an unborn baby. This graff(http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB:Cancer_smoking_lung_cancer_correlation_from_NIH.svg) shows us there seems to be close connection between the amount of smoking and the risk of lung cancer's death. Besides, more than 12% of all death per a year in japan is caused by smoking. For such reasons,smoking isn't good for our health. Second of all, smoking causes the great loss rather than benefits. Latest Japanese government's report shows that the cigarette's tax income is amount to 227 billion dollars. However the World Bank expects the abolition of smoking would generate more job opportunities and business chances. Futhermore Japanese government reported that smoking causes more than 400 billion social loss. According to the interesting sturdy, the higher the ratio of smoking become, the more the number of those who are in porvoty is in a society. So it is absolute that smoking causes great loss rather than benefits on our society in terms of fibnance. In conclusion, i'm for this statement because smoking causes great loss rather than benefits in both terms of health and finance. However , on behalf of smokers, they have rights to smoke and smoking is a relaxing activity for them. And it seems neary impossible to ban smoking completely. So the government or the owner of restaurants should make place for smokers."

So I was excited to read Manga after a long time and It ignited me. When I went back home, I started to read my collection of Manga eagerly without almost eating and drinking. When I finished, it was this morning. Now I'm very sleepy. but It's my own fault!! By the way, Manga I like are ""ã‚¸ãƒ§ã‚¸ãƒ§ã®å¥‡å¦™ãªå†’é™º"" ,""City Hunter"" ,""ãƒ€ã‚¤ã®å¤§å†’é™º"" and so on.

My nose is itchy because I carelessly forgot to wear a mask. Anyway, I changed the location of all furniture and discarded things I don't need any more. So I feel as if my room got back freshness. Having finished year-end house cleaning, the only thing I do in the rest of this year is to just enjoy myself greatly!"
Japanese,"Copyright China is frequently criticized over invasions of copyright. Of course, invasions should be regulated, but today copyright regulations are so strict that it is inevitable to take a risk of accusation when someone wants to start something new, especially in a software industry. In this case, the patent might obstruct the innovation, might give priority to a less important thing."

Japanese,"Holland and Belgium My husband and I went to Holland and Belgium from last Tuesday to this Tuesday. We enjoyed many famous paintings and five World Heritage sites. Bruges, one of the World Heritage sites, looks like a medieval town. I think Bruges is the best place I visited this time. Incidentally, when I was waiting for the Cathedral Notre-Dame to open in Antwerp, a young woman came up and talked to me. She seemed to be doing a sightseeing questionnaire. She asked me many questions; Japanese? How many days are you in Antwerp? Did you stay a hotel in Antwerp? Whatâ€™s the hotel name? How many stars does the hotel have? What was your first impression of here? Where are you going in Antwerp? Where else are you going in Belgium? And she asked me, â€œHow old are you?â€ I said, â€œFifty-seven.â€ She wrote down thirty-seven. I said, â€œNo, fifty-seven.â€ I must have looked like a thirty-seven-year-old woman because she was surprised. I want to believe that my pronunciation wasn't the problem."
Japanese,It's the best to ask Japanese people. If I wasn't sure about English I would ask Japanese people because my English still not completed so sometimes I can't understand when native people teach me in English. So I often ask Japanese people when I mistake in English or I have a few questions about English. I often ask about English at Yahoo chiebukuro which is Yahoo Japan! If you have a questions you should try to ask them. I think they'll give you a good anwers and you'll resolve your Japanese problems. It might good if you ask them in English because they can speak English.
Japanese,"It Is Hard For Me To Express My Thinking In English I have a question. If you can't express your thinking in another language which you are studying, how do you try to describe it? Do you try to communicate with a body language? If you can't use a body language in front of them, what do you say? Do you give up to communicate them? I have some experience like that. I have a student of double schools. One is a real English conversation school, and the other is an online English conversation school. Since my English teacher at real conversation school, Sean can speak Japanese, if I can't understand his English, he suggests me some Japanese words. However, my online English teachers are all Filipinos, and they can't speak Japanese at all, I make some trouble with them. I can understand their conversation but I sometimes can't explain my thinking well. Although at that time, I try to figure out different phrases, it is quite hard for me to explain my thinking. I know why I can't express my thinking well. That's why my English vocabularies are very poor. I must remember more synonyms and antonyms. How do you remember new words? How do you keep new words in your mind? They are also hard for me."

They seem to very think so because they have never seen my child."
Japanese,"Car Talk Puzzler It's Saturday morning. I was having brunch and listening to one of my favorite radio shows, ""Car Talk"" on NPR. Although I don't drive myself, I love the ""America's funniest auto mechanics"" brothers talk and answer listeners' questions. I laugh at least five times during the show. Every week they have ""Car Talk Puzzler, in which one of the listeners who send the correct answer gets a prize. They told us the answer to the quiz last week. I found it interesting, so I tried to write it down. ********** I'm thinking of two inventions long ago. One of them has thousands of moving parts. The other has one part and it doesn't move. They both do the same thing. Or at least they did the same thing. Oh, they still do. If you had these in front of you. They would still do what they did. Both of them measure something. What they measure is the passage of time. One is the sand glass which has thousands of grains of sand that move, and the other one is the sun dial. Do they not but have no moving parts. It sits there . the sun moves. But the sun dial doesn't. And both of them measure the passage of time. And one has thousands of moving parts. ********** I couldn't get the words in this sentence very well. ""Do they not but have no moving parts."" Do you have any idea what it could be? I know they will post the answer in their webpage in a couple of days, but.... I CNNNOT WAIT! I'd appreciate if you could clear up the fog on my mind... thank you."
Japanese,"A Tip To Study Your Other Language My Australian friend is a very diligent Japanese leaner, and he has given me lots of good influence. Today I would love to share one of them with you. Right now he is focusing on making a famous Japanese people's names list because of expanding his knowledge about Japan. I think that it is a very effective for him to chat with native Japanese speakers. That's because when he listens to some Japanese famous people's name in conversations, if he doesn't know the names, he can't keep up with the conversations. However, if he has some knowledge about them, he can enjoy conversations with his Japanese friends. For instance; Please imagine I'm chatting with you. Me: Yesterday I enjoyed watching ""Ryomaden"". You: Oh, yeah? Who is playing in the drama? Me: One of my favorite actors, Masaharu Fukuyama. Although I guess you already notice, if you don't know who is Masaharu Fukuyama, how do you keep the conversation? You might be ask what he looks like. After you listen to about it, what is your next question? I guess that it might be difficult for you to continue our conversations because you are lack of information of Masaharu Fukuyama. On the other hand, if you already know him, after you listen to his name, you can pop up his picture and his representative works. To continue conversations might be much easier for you. You might be give some tips about him that your Japanese friends haven't known yet. It will happen to me when I chat with my foreign friends. Therefore, I also would like to make my own famous people's list. I think it's very useful when I chat with my foreign friends in a group conversation."

Japanese,"Technology, Entertainment and Design My English learning tool these days is TED movies. http://www.ted.com/ TED movies is very very interesting for me.

Japanese,"My typical Sunday Even though this is Sunday, I got up at six in the morning and got my jobs done as usual. I had expected it would be windy around noon- because the forecast said so- so I decided to attend a tennis circle, which I usually attend during weekend, earlier. I started to play at 8:40 instead of usual 9:00. And, I left there at 9:40- earlier than usual- because the wind got stronger as I expected. Now, I came back to my house and started to learn English again. My wife is still sleeping as she usually sleeps until almost noon at weekends. Sunday is the most likely off day for me, too, because I have only little things to do for our business. I think my wife and I will go to an Italian restaurant for our lunch because my wife told me that she wanted to eat Italian food yesterday. There are so many Italian restaurants in my city. We will go to our favorite one. Their food, service, and white based open interior is just better than others. After that, I think we will go to the cafe and read books written in English. My wife will read ""Charie and the Chocolate Factory,' and I will read ""Hole,"" which we have just started to read. Anyway, I am happy about that she has lately started to read English books and it seems she has been really enjoying it. It has become our common hobby. After that, we might go to the shopping mall which has just opened last year. I have nothing to buy but for window shopping. I don't know if we will go out again for dinner or not tonight-most of the time we go out. What I am sure is that the rest of the dinner time I will just keep studying English and have a fun. I think this is my typical Sunday. Nothing is special but I really like it."
Japanese,"Please, Could/Would 1. Please pass me the salt. One night, a family is having dinner togheter. A child says, ""Pass me the salt,"" and then Mother says, ""What's the magic word?"" then a child says, ""Please pass me the salt."" But in some formal settings/circumstances/situations, adding just please is still a bit impolite. A man, who are annoyed by the chatter of girls next to his room, would say, ""Speak lower, please."" This phrse wear a bit caution or irritation. 2. Yes, please On a plane, a passenger was asked by a flight attendant, ""Would you like a cup of coffe?"" then she says, ""Plase."" I think it is more polite than just saying, ""Yes."" I can say, ""Yes"" and then ""Please"" for adding some politeness. Otherwise two kids, Mary and Jane, are arguing about Jane's cheat on a test. Mary says, ""I'm gonna tell what you did to Mr. Grayman ( who is their terrifying teacher)"", then Jane said, ""Please"" in an aloof manner. This please means, ""I don't care,"" or ""Whatever,"" or ""Do as you like."" 3. Oh, please I always tell jokes even if it is not appropriate or not. Men are easy to tell jokes to but I know telling jokes often disturbs one's mind. The other day, on Skype, I got a first contact from a Turkish woman. She said she is woking as an import management adviser. I asked her, ""So, what's kind of product you handle? Weapons or drags?"" She said, ""Oh, please."" I think this means, ""Oh my God, please stop kidding/telling jokes."" it might be no jokes at all if she really import weapons, but in this case it worked indeed as a joke. 4. Could you? Would you? What is the difference between, ""Could you open the door?"" and ""Would you open the door?"" In my understandings basically ""Could you...?"" means, ""Are you able to...?"" and ""Would you...?"" means, ""Are you willing to...?"" or ""Do you have a will to...?"" ""Could you... ?"" or ""Can you...?"" is probably used by bank robbers: Bank robber1: Hey, can you open the door? Bank robber2: I can't. Bank robber1: Ok, I'm done with you. Die. *bang* ""Would you...?"" is used by Mom. Mom: Would you stop playing games? Child: No. Mom: Would you do your homework? Child: No. Mom: Would I get angry? Child: Yes. Mom: Ok, you make me angry. *bang* Would you give me some comments, please. Thanks in advance."

Japanese,"ä¹å·žæ–°å¹¹ç·šé–‹é€šè¨˜å¿µCM - A video celebrating the new bullet train in Kyushu island won an internatinal award!!! Hi everyone, A new bullet train called Kyushu Shinkansen ä¹å·žæ–°å¹¹ç·š opened on 12th Mar 2011, the day after the earthquake. The bullet train links Kagoshima and Hakata by 1h19m, and Kagoshima and Osaka by 3h45m. Before its opening, a short TV commercial had been broadcasted in Kyushu islands every day, introducing a special train due on 20th Feb equipped with a camera to shoot people celebrating the opening of the new line along the rails. Event announcement (15 sec) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDOyJtAQulo On 20th Feb at 10:55, the special train with rainbow colour decorations departed the Kagoshima central station and ran towards Hakata for the shooting. It is said that 15,000~20,000 people joined this event along the rails of 250 km. And below is the TV commercial shot from the special train. This TV commercial was broadcasted on 9th Mar. But it was only two days later when the earthquake occurred and the TV commercial was once withdrawn from the TV. On the next day, all the scheduled opening ceremonies were cancelled, and the bullet train started running quietly. In April a lot of people still remembered the 'phantom' video and they demanded to watch it on TV again. A morning news TV programme featured the making of this video. Then it started to be broadcasted again since 22nd April. The commercial video won the gold and sliver prizes in International Advertising Festival held in Cannes. OK, then. Now enjoy the wonderful video! ã€Œç¥! ä¹å·žç¸¦æ–­ã‚¦ã‚§ãƒ¼ãƒ–ã€ä¹å·žæ–°å¹¹ç·šå…¨ç·šé–‹é€š ç‰¹åˆ¥ç·¨ (180 sec) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5kU6mImUh0 ç·é›†ç·¨ (180 sec) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBAqod0_DPw More videos available from here http://www.youtube.com/user/shuku9wave Picture gallery http://www.shuku9.com/poster.html Probably because now I watch this after the devastation by the tsunami, and also because I'm off Japan, I'm so moved by the lovely people in this video.

Japanese,"Okonomiyaki Last weak I went to an Okonomiyaki ( Japanese pancake-like food) restaurant in Kobe with very empty stomach. On that day, my friends promised to treat me dinner and I asked them the Okonomiyaki. The restaurant offers many different types of Okonomiyaki; for example, cheese, Kimuchi or rice cake. We had a deal because I bought some American brand clothes for them in US and carried them in my suitcase to Japan. In return, I got complimentary Okonomiyaki. My friends love American casual brand clothes such as Abercrombie and Hollister. Those clothes are very expensive in Japan and very hard to get. That's why my friends feel very special when they wear. It seems the brand became popular in Japan because Japanese celebrity or model in magazines wear. In America, I heard that those brands are basically for teenagers. My friends turned already late thirties; however, they love the design and say that the size fits very well. I think they feel still young in the clothes. I am also pretty happy when I see my friends wear American clothes happily. Thanks to the American brand clothes, I had really lot of Okonomiyaki."

When opening of a new school year, a teacher visits homes of each students of their home room that have about 40 students. The purpose of visiting is to know the family environmentÂ of each student. But they stays at each home only 20 minutes! Just 20 minutes! Is it enough to understandÂ a family environment of each student?

Japanese,"TOEFL TOPIC #1 TOEFL TOPIC Some people prefer to work for a large company: others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice. Answer Some people prefer to work at a large company. Other people would like to work at a small company. I would like to work at small company. There are three reasons that I prefer to work at a small company. First reason I prefer working at a small company is that itâ€™s easer to know people who work at the company. If I work at company, I would like to know people who work at the company and what they do at the company. However, if it is a large company, it would be harder to know every one, and their work. So I would like to work at a small company. The second reason I would like to work at a small company is that I would like to think people at work as a friend or family. Now Iâ€™m working at a small company. There are only six people working there. When we are busy we help each other, because we think each other as friends and family. If it is in a large company, it would be hard to think that way. This is the second reason that I would like to work at a small company. The third reason I prefer working at a small company is that I would have more chance to communicate with an owner of the company. I worked at a large company, and I had never met the owner. However, Iâ€™m in a small company, and I have many chances to talk to the owner. So that, I am able to know what the owner expect to me, and what he want me to do. Those are three reasons that I would like to work at a small company. However, I realized that everyone has a different opinion of this. I will respect all of our view."

It is make the responsibility vague. because of it has been decided by everyone at the conference.

One of them requires me to collect data or information about the subject, which is quite troublesome.

I found it more interesting than I had expected to help foreign people with Japanese, and answer their questions. There is, however, a happy news to me. A few days ago, I was hired to a part-time job! I can earn some money at last. Now, Japan has a sluggish economy, which makes it rather hard to find a job. Especially in Hokkaido, where I live, it is almost impossible for me to find a job I'm interested in. I can't help feeing nobody can change this economic situation of Japan."

Japanese,"Sugiyama enjoying life away from court By GUS FIELDING Kyodo News Ai Sugiyama on Monday warned not to expect a Kimiko Date Krumm-style comeback and says she is loving life outside the WTA Tour after recently drawing to a close her 17-year career. http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/st20091208a1.html ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Ai Sugiyama, She's professional Tennis player, She has been in the world tennis competition for sixty-two straight times during 17 years. She was not able to get a winning individual as same as Kurumu Date, she backed to this field since twelve years and was a great success. But Sugiyama's consecutive game record is registered in the Guinness Book of Record as the new world record. Personally, I need to learn her emotional strength that she managed to get in the game for sixty-two straight times during her experience. Naturally, she had a lot of tough situations such as injure, spiritual problem. Sometime she might felt herself that I want to quit tennis now because I don't want play tennis anymore, maybe she thought. I heard from her interview on TV before she's going to announce her retirement in front of public, and she said that it was most important helps was my mother, and her support's helped my career, I would I had to retire tennis earlier without it. In fact, some tennis player hired private assistant coach, some other's asked their relate family. I think that their relate are so helpful. For example, they make healthy choices about the foods her eats and let her tell everything she's worry. Because she only has a two-month to spend in Japan when she goes on the road. I had an idea when I was young which I want to do everything I have to do is sometime good. But it has limitations; I often had a mistake when I tried to everything I want to do. I'm able to learn again that I can't achieve anything from her experience; we need to make many great supporters and to have an emotion to belong together."
Japanese,"The Sky Is The Limit When I was a child, I thought that my growing capability was considerably limited.

For example, when I was in high school, my grade was so bad that I couldn't enter a med school. To be honest, I couldn't even take an entrance examination for it. I gave up a dream to be a medical doctor and I entered other university's Faculty of Science. But there I had studied very hard. And in my researh activity about oncology, I thought I didn't have any choice to enter a med school to study the medicine. Eventualy I became a medical student.

I bumped into an English teacher from the U. S. a few days ago. I have talked with him in English several times, but it has been for a while since the last time I saw him. As soon as I noticed him, I said, â€œGood morning.â€ He turned over toward me and replied with a smile. Then several topics I would like to talk with him came into my mind. However, unfortunately they were all in Japanese. I felt I needed some time to translate them in English but I didnâ€™t want to keep him waiting. Maybe I didnâ€™t want to admit I couldnâ€™t speak English fluently. I didnâ€™t want to hobble or get time saying â€œErrâ€ or â€œHmm.â€ What I really said was â€œHow are you?â€ He was very friendly and said he was sleepy because he had watched the soccer game where Japan beat Denmark early in the morning. I smiled and wanted to say something more about it. I really did want to. However, I ended up saying, â€œOh, really?â€ and â€œGood-bye.â€ I could have said, â€œDid you root for Japan or Denmark?â€ or â€œI didnâ€™t think American people were into soccer unlike Japanese.â€ That was what I thought afterwards. What happened to me? I thought I had already conquered the fear of making mistakes. Now I feel I am getting back to the first stage."
Japanese,"Shopping I went shopping with my little sister:) First, we took PURIKURA! Do you know PURIKURA? PURIKURA is photo seal. we can write messages in our picture.

Japanese,"Skype Do you use Skype? I think Skype is very useful to learn a foreign language. Many people are good at writing and reading a foreign language. However, speaking and listening are more difficult to learn than them because you are in limited in opportunity to talk with a person who speaks your learning language. You can find a language exchanging partner. Why don't you use Skype? I really understand it. Is there a problem? Yes, there is a BIG problem. .... Well, .... you know, I'm very shy!!! I wish I had courage!!! Please contact me on Skype :) skype ID: kazuhiro1209 Thank you!!!!!'"
Japanese,"Lupin the 3rd - Castle of Cagliostro I watched ""Lupin the 3rd - Castle of Cagliostro"" on TV tonight. Do you know this Japanese animation movie? This is the first movie that ""Hayao Miyazaki"" directed. Hayao Miyazaki is a very famous animation director. I was very impressed by this movie when I was a child. And I watched many times until now. Every times, I could enjoy watching it. And tonight, I watched it with my children. I felt I return to my childhood. Anyway I think it is a greatest movie in Japanese animation. If you have a chance to watch it, you have a great time while you watch it."
Japanese,"Kamakura Today I will write about my hometown Kamakura. It will take about fifty minutes from the central area of Tokyo to Kamakura by train. Since the city is near to Tokyo, you may have visited. Kamakura is one of old capitals in Japan. It is filled with a lot of temples and shrines. You may visit the city in order to touch Japanese traditions. It is also known as one of representative urban resorts in Japan. Many Japanese millionaires have vacation houses there, and many and famous artists like to live there. I sometimes go to Kamakura Museum of Literature. The mansion was Marquis Maeda's resort house, but the City of Kamakura has it today, and it is used as the Museum of Literature. A reason that I like the mansion's garden is because we can look over Kamakura from there. I believe that you will enjoy my city, but I will tell you about the another face of Kamakura. The Japanese imperial family has a history of about 2700 years. Basically, it is impossible for a family to maintain powers such a long time. The reason why the Japanese imperial family wasn't uncrowned was because it didn't have powers, and it was not strong. Today, Japan is virtually a republic, and the Emperor has no political power. However, it was very rare for Emperors to virtually have powers in Japanese history. The current constitutional monarchy is traditionally-based in Japanese history. Since 1185 until 1868, samurai had ruled Japan. The first samurai dictator was Minamoto no Yoritomo. Although the imperial court was in Kyoto, Yoritomo established his government in Kamakura, and the government had ruled the whole Japan for about 150 years. Kamakura had been virtually the capital of Japan since 1185. The governments that was established by samurai, and ruled the whole Japan, are called 'bakufu (shogunate)'. Because the government in Kamakura was the first shogunate in Japanese history, it was not systemically stable. The last shogunate Edo bakufu could learn from foregoers' experiences, so it could have stably ruled Japan for 270 years. However, samurai in Kamakura were pioneers to rule Japan, so they couldn't have any foregoers. This is a reason why the history of Kamakura was too bloody. The moguls of the Kamakura shogunate competed with one another in order to seize powers. Since they were samurai, their competitions meant killing each other. There are a lot of sites of massacres in Kamakura. Perhaps, this was a reason why Kamakura samurai had to build a lot of temples. It's because mafia are basically pious. The Hojo clan was the most powerful mogul in the Kamakura shogunate, and they killed a lot of other clans. Some of my ancestors were victims of them. Although they didn't have any titles, they were virtually the ruler of Japan. It's difficult to criticize their politics. They were certainly violent, but they were not egoistic at least. They tried to attain their ideals for people. So they had been able to maintain their powers for about 150 years. However, one day, Mongolia tried to invade into Japan. Mongolia already occupied China, Korea, Persia, Russia and East European countries, but Japan could fortunately repel them. Although Japan could maintain its independence, the government was badly bruised economically. The Hojo clan didn't have a power to bottle frustrations of other people anymore. The imperial court in Kyoto rose up in order to regain political powers from the Hojo clan, and a lot of samurai wanted to be imperial soldiers. Their ruination was very rapid. The private army of the Hojo clan was defeated by the imperial army in various regions in Japan, and Kamakura was the last site of them. In May 1333, an imperial general Nitta Yoshisada invaded into the city with his soldiers, the people who belonged to the Hojo clan gathered at Tosho-ji temple that was their family temple. There were about 1000 people who were irrespective of age or sex. They fired the temple, and killed themselves in the fire. So there is not the temple today. The second image is the place where there was the temple. It is a very important place of Japanese history, but sightseers rarely visit. I have visited the place, but the other day, I visited again for praying. Nobody was there except me. Kamakura is beautiful. You will enjoy it, but I think that you will be able to enjoy more, if you know the history more. Thank you."

Japanese,"AIka Ota members of AKB48 My favorite member in AKB48 is Aika Ota. Because she is adorable and bratty(tsundere in japanese). And she is plump a little. But such shape atracts me a lot. AKB has a system of general election. Members are ranked by people who buy assigned CD. Members who are ranked higher than 21th can sing specific CD or next CD as selection members and ranked higher than 12th can sing such CD on TV. On the other hand,who are ranked higher than 40 can sing a song the accompanying the title song on a two-track CD as under girls. General election was held two times. She was ranked 20th at first general election. So she was elected a member who can sing. But at second general election,she was ranked 22th. She was not elected selection members. I was so sad. But she was center of under girls. Because She was 1th of under girls. It was happy for me. By the way,today is her 16th birthday. I bought cakes to conguratulate her."

Japanese,"CNN + NHK business English program At last I decided to buy an English text book. It was one of the NHK(, which is our National Broadcasting Corporation) radio programs and intended for advanced English learners or business people. In fact, the program has a good reputation for English learners because the high-level words, idioms etc are very helpful for them to improve their English skills. Not only these phrases, but the contexts are also interesting. However, sentences of the contexts are relatively complicated if you ask me. After all, there aren't all simple sentences in terms of talking in a daily life. That's why I had been reluctant to brush up on my English skills through the program and text book. As I prefer CNN, BBC and NHK news in bilingual, listening to these English news is one of my daily routine study of English. I can learn the machinery of the politics, society etc as well. I meant people who are advanced level have many varieties of knowledge and can discuss when they are required besides these sophisticated words. ( Some say these news also use formal expressions, aren't suitable for talking, though...) However, I had a whim to buy the text book for a change. Right away, I listened to the radio program through the Internet. The vignette of the beginning of this month were so intriguing and helpful for me, although the sentences were a wee bit long. :D Uh... I think I'll purchase it regularly.... ^^"
Japanese,"27/12/10 - Camping (part 1) If you have time, please drop by and click on one of the 3 buttons (the white one is a priority) (so that more people will have a chance to read my blog!) http://kenichiokuma.blog86.fc2.com/ -------------------------------- I joined a camping that an aussie planed last monday and tuesday. It was a bush and costal walk from Otford Station to Bundeena through a royal national park, which is about 27km in total. Seven people took part in it (one Aussie, three Peruvians, one Laotian, two Japanese). We slept in a tent at a place near the beach at Matawalla after we moved 15km from the starting point. We walked to Bundeena, which is 12 km, and then took a ferry to Cronulla on the second day. On the first day (the 27th), it was raining and cold in the morning. Because of the weather, the path was muddy and slippy. Sometimes we couldn't even find the track. It was foggy and we couldn't see landscapes. Everyone might have thought that today was the wrong day. In the afternoon, it stopped raining, but we kept walking on the (kind of) steep mountain path. (I want to say.... that was not so steep.... but many ups and downs... how can you call that in English?) I can't remember how many mountains we crossed. I felt hard in climbing and going down mountains. I felt the harsh ocean due to the rain. I felt close to nature and the power of nature. After a long walk, we finally found a place to sleep near the ocean. We had 3 minutes cup noodles after heating a stove. Unfortunately, it was very windy so that we couldn't make fire. (camp fire?) We made tents and slept around 9:30 since we were very tired. haha People say they forget their fatigues from hard work when they was able to see beautiful landscapes. Yes, I barely felt like that, but my tiredness was still there. haha The first day became very very different from my usually day. continue... (Please drop by my blog later and see my pictures there) can you think of a better title?"
Japanese,"Stop it!! I took part in an English club this morning as usual. I had been not sure whether I could participate in this time because I had expected another English club would fall on today. Luckily, the club is being scheduled tomorrow, so I was willing to join today's meeting. Today, there were 5 of us plus an English native speaker. We talked about a variety of topics. Needless to say that I really enjoyed chatting away in English. After that, we buckled down to reading an article which the native speaker had prepared. Then, ""it "" embarrassed me: my stomach rumbled loudly... Oh, my..... To be honest, I had skipped breakfast this morning... There were some reasons, though....

Japanese,"Ichiro !! Ichiro is the best baseball player I've ever seen in Japan !! He can do hit, defend throw, and run well. Besides that,he has a strong mentality and philosophy. He can keep doing same performance and preparation every game and he also eats curry at lunch everyday. He has had same lunch which Yumiko(his wife) has made for 9 years. He doesn't practice for his job. He likes baseball and he works out. He also thinks that playing for himself is for his team benefit because he knows it's the most strict things to play for himself. He set a new MLB record of 9 consective 200-hit seasons last year. I'm looking forward to watching him again this year. I also have to keep doing my best like him. What!? Thank you, Jordan"

Japanese,"Softball Yesterday, Japanese softball team finally got a golden medal!! They got a silver medal at the Sydney Olympic and They got a bronze medal at the Athens Olympics. The International Olympic Committee has decided to eliminate baseball and softball from the 2012 London Olympics. So I was especially glad because for softball this Olympics was final. When I was junior high school student, I joined a softball team of the school. When I joined the softball team, the manager moved different school. The manager was very good at teaching the softball. So my senior attended national convention many times. And practicing was very hard. I heard that my senior went back home at 10 p.m. every day and morning practicing started from at 6 a.m. The day off was only the New Year. When I joined the softball team, since the manager moved. So the practicing was not harder than my senior. We didnâ€™t have the morning practice but we didnâ€™t have day off except the New Year. The rule was strict. We had to cut our hair on the ear. When we played the softball, we had to a towel tied around our head. The towels were written good words which our senior wrote them with all their heart. When we were called someone or were warned, we had to say â€œhaiâ€ and raise our clenched hand. Usually, strong team seniors are strict against their junior. However, our seniors were really kind. I yearned our seniors because they were strong and kind^^ If you see the softball players, you can understand that it is difficult to distinguish which they are male or female. Actually when I was junior high school student, I was mistaken a boy. When I tried to enter the womenâ€™s restroom, a female told to me â€œ You have to use the menâ€™s restroom.â€ >< One day, a new girl classmate came to my class. She fell me in love at first sight. After she saw that I wore the skirt. She was very reprised!! When I saw different team player, I talked with my teammate â€œ She is really a girl?? There is no way I can see.â€ (â†Itâ€™s really rude!!ï¼‰ For me, the softball practicing was really tough. So I have decided that when I become a high school student, I never join any sports team!!!!"

Plus he said he called a stripper to the school!!she danced almost naked. He said the principal also enjoyed that. I'm sure he mentioned his school was very strict though: And for a graduation trip, schoolies( means 3rd year students, right?) go to Gold Coast and have fan with toolies(means 20s want to have fun with schoolies, right?)

Japanese,"The reason why Christianity does not take root in Japan. One of my friends asked me that why Christianity does not take root in Japan. So I wanna think about it and write down my thoughts. Have you ever read ''Kojiki''? It's a myth of Japanese gods. We have hundreds of gods.(the representative of our Japanese gods is woman, called Amaterasu.) Japan is not monotheistic religious country. And I think this is the biggest difference and that's the reason why Christianity does not take root in Japan. Japanese religion such as Shinto is animism and nature worship. So, in Japan, we don't get used to the idea of monotheistic religion, such as Christianity or Islam."

There are many up-to-date drama in North America. Then I subsequently watch many kind of it such as Lost, Heroes, etc,. I couldn't found drama, however, as much hilarious as Friends. The thing I'm wondering is that Friends have much blow to today's American, or It just funny because of my personal penchant. In addition, I'm also curious about whether North American like to watch television or not in general? Thank you for reading. p. s.

Korean,"the project in my class. I have an on-going project in â€œbeing a leaderâ€ class this semester. That project goal is to gather people and help people as much as possible. As I was in Taiwan as an exchange student and in there, I made a Korean club that is helping Taiwanese friends to study Korea. And after I came back to Korea, I realized there are many people who want to study Chinese in Korea. So I thought about connecting between Taiwanese who want to study Korean and Korean who want to study Chinese. So for that project, I made a club on Face book. And I made my Taiwan friends make people with my Korean friends. Now because that club, theyâ€™re having personal tutors and theyâ€™re helping each other. Itâ€™s going to bigger and bigger. From this project, I felt I can do something to help people and from that thinking, Iâ€™ve also learned so many things. So I feel really thankful to take this class."

Korean,"Relationship Between Suicide Rate And Happiness On the commute time, I used to listen to radio. Today, I got to know some interesting news regarding the relationship between suicide rate and happiness. As you know, Korea has recorded high suicide rate.* I believed that the higher suicide rate, the lower happiness because people tend to commit suicide when they're too frustrated to find any hope over the course of their lives. * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate But the host argued that suicide rate is not a crucial factor to decide whether people in a country are happy or not. Statistically, the difference of rate by country is not significant. Furthermore, some countries where national religion is Catholic have recorded low rate not because folks in these countries are happier but because Catholic church has prohibited suicide. What a surprise! I've talked to my friends that most Korean are not happy based on the fact that Korea has high suicide rate. But the figure is no longer appropriate in supporting my idea according to the host's remarks. Dear Lang-8 friends, do you agree with the host's idea on suicide rate?"

Korean,"Anxiety to be beautiful Recently, one of my friends got plastic surgery. After we got a meeting, I met her and I thought she became pretty. All over the world, people blame surgery for cosmetic purpose. most of people seem to find out whether entertainers have ever had the surgery. Even some of people became beauty after the surgery, most people are just interested in what is their face before it and say that they're too ugly, laughing at them. But I can't understand this. Is there no chance for the ugly to be beautiful? They tried to be pretty or handsome but people just like to say ""Oh, they did it. it's so noticeable."" This world isn't impartial so the ugly tend to be at a disadvantage. In serious case, these people can be rejected in job interview because interviewees firstly check up documents about appliances, including their pictures. As a result, they've tried to overcome it, but the severe world is still laughing at them. Human have been trying to make impossible things possible. and break several inequalities such as discrimination between men and women. Of course, there is no rank of beauty and maybe equality of beauty sounds strange. But what I want to say is that there is no opportunity to avoid partiality about beauty, If we stick our views of it."

My friend also have same problem of that. and most of Korean who study English have that problem I think. The problem is that I can't read English fast. Actually when I read Korean books I read not so fast. I think it's the similiar problem. Anyway about 7 weeks ago I took TOEIC and didn't read all the writings so I couldn't solve some questions. I know that the problem is my reading speed. So I thought if I read about 'Speed Reading' I can read English normal speed. Of course that book is written by Korean. But actually I don't know that it's the best way to strengthen my reading speed. Is anybody knows the key of this problem?"
Korean,"Blossom It's a time for whole plants to blossom. Around my street, flowers stared to blossom. Some flowers already faded away. After flowers blossom, they sustain for only several days. Nature is teaching a lot of lessons to us. First, there is life and death. There is a time to blossom and also to disappear. Similarly, our life is same as nature. A new birth happens at this moment and a life goes to ashes at the same time. Second, nature is teaching humility to us. After prosperity, there is a disappearance. Our life is the same. We have a peak time in someday but we should not be exalted because anguish is waiting for us. A beauty can't exsit long enough. It's a pity but we don't feel its value seriously if a beauty sustains forever. Third, nature has a wonderful rule: give and take rule. A nature gives other creatures when it takes something from other creatures. We have to repsect nature and make an effort to preserve it for us and next generations."
Korean,"new expressions ............... Thesedays, I go to kind of small language academy called micasa. During the class, we give short presentations about what's going on our daily lives. Last time, I fuzzed everytime as speaking more than usual. It was not just because I was nervous, also it was the result of studying harder for the recent days. Sounds irony, doesn;t it ? What I mean is the more I study about expressions or vocabularies, the more I'm confused, because everytime I try to use new things, it doesn't come to my mind as automatically as I wish, and it makes me mummuring(?). I wish I could use them directly as I acquire. I know it's not going to happen, since everything takes some amount of pain. I have limited expressions at my disposal especially when I speak. I use same things all the time, which I got used to. I want to go to the next step. Could anyone give me some advice ?"
Korean,"The people who talk about my happiness. They say It's better to have a dream that is not really big. They say happiness is more important than my dream so It's better to have a normal dream. I can't help but wonder what is a 'normal dream'. If you don't want to live like a monk without ambition, you should be truthful with your desires and do your best to achive your goals. Is it wrong to set a goal trying to do my best? People give money for workers since we don't have better things to reward with. Regarding we concede we are estimated with money, is there any problem if I try to be worth big money? If I get a job that everyone can do like convenience store jobs, does it make me happy normally? Is it a sin to do my best to make good money in the future? I have desires. I want to live in a warm house, I want to take showers with hot water, I want to give money willingly if there are poor students like I was. It could be more selfish to make money only for my welfare. I don't care if they live like that or not. I want to be a person who influence a lot of people in good ways in the future. Just I don't want people around me to demand me to have normal dream and give up my ambitions."

Korean,"Drug Use by Teenagers In a pharmacy, people can buy a medicine for pain. Of course, some medicines require a prescription because they can cause toxic symptoms. The reason is that components of drugs are in the medicine drugs release people's pain because basically, drugs make people happy. However, some people are using drugs in a wrong way. They just use them pleasure. It is dangerous because it can spoil people's life. It is more dangerous for teenagers. Unfortunately, drugs use by teenagers is increasing. There are three reasons for this; stress from parents, persuasion from drug dealers, and curiosity about drugs. First of all, teenagers are tempted by drugs because of parents' pressure. Parents usually say someting that they want their children to do, such as studying, habits, or activities that they are doing. Since the teenagers cannot do what they want, they feel uncomfortable and sometimes angry, but it is hard to express their feeling. They seek someting else to release their feelings. Therefore, they start to abuse drugs. Even though they know that they are bad, they cannot avoid them. Next, they are easily affected by drug dealers. Drug dealers usually want to find a person who has weak points and easily accepts their behavior. Adults usually have strong opinions and social position. Because of that, only some adults who have personal problems have an interest in drugs. However, teenagers don't have these problems, but they are easily persuaded. Since they don't even know it is wrong. They cannot quit the behavior. Last, teenagers have a lot of curiosity about everything. It is a natural instinct. Teenagres also naturally have an interest in drugs. Of course, adults say it is bad. However, teenagers have more interest in drugs because screct tings can trigger their curiosity. Although they are well-educated, the curiosity still remaing. The chances that teenagers will use drugs always remain. In conclusion, drugs are being used as a medicine because it can relase pain, but teenagers use them for pleasure. The reason is that they feel preasure from parents, and they can easily be affected by drug dealers because drug dealers want them. Moreover, basically, teenagers have a lot of curiousity so that they natually have interest in drugs. To protect them, special education for teenagers is needed."

Korean,"The usage of a final constant â€œã……â€ between combined words. This lecture is for upper level Korean learners. And if you have knowledge on Chinese it would be helpful. As you know(or not) most Korean words are originated from Chinese. And there are some Korean words which are consist of (or comprised of?) two Korean words which are originated from Chinese character. Mostly, they donâ€™t transform, but there are 6 exceptional words which should put â€œã……â€ as a final consonant if a former word does not have any final consonant. One of the words is ìˆ«ìž. Which is a combined words of ìˆ˜(æ•¸: number) and ìž(å­—:character). Since the other 5 words are not commonly used, ìˆ«ìž is enough to explain. In addition, when you are using a combined words of a word with Chinese meaning and Korean words you also have to put â€œã……â€ in between. For example, ì½”(nose: pure Korean) + ë³‘(sinckness: originated from Chinese) should be ì½§ë³‘. This grammar system is even difficult for Korean and they make a mistake a lot. If you can utilize the system perfectly, it means you are better than me in KoreanïŠ"

However, I heard the noises that the mouses made it many times. Around 3 months ago, there were much noise on the ceiling in my place which it might be because they bore the youngs. Sounded like that somethings run very fast or someone scratchs something. When I first heard that sound, I couldn't sleep well. I used to wake up whenever I heard the noise on the ceiling. I told my second master of school living next door about that I couldn't sleep well because of the noise which mouses made, so do something. After that, there wasn't any noise for a few weeks. He told me that he put the rat poison down on the ceiling. Um....... However, Now, other rats reappeared. They didn't harm to me so far.

Any comment and correction are passionately, eagerly, intensively welcomed. :) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Seoul will nurture 1000 ventures in green industry by 2013 and invest 2.24 trillion won in the green growth sector. The Green Growth Committee under the presidential office opened the 8th Green Growth Committee meeting led by President Lee Myeung-bak on Thursday under the theme of ""Green Growth in the market"" focusing on promoting green market. The government discussed ways to grow green firms including encouraging green start-ups, improving green finance and securing relevant personnel, developing green technologies, advancing into global green market. Through these strategies, the spokesperson said, Korea will localize production of main parts and materials in the green industry, most of which have been dependent on imports. He added local green firms will also be supported to make inroads into overseas market. The government said that 30 largest conglomerates of Korea put 890billion won into clean energy, 5.3trillion won in green car and 4.3 trillion won in the next generation power system. The financial budget for green growth fund will be expanded from 10.5 billion won last year to ten folded 1.1 trillion won by 2013 and as for green R&D, the government's expense will increase from 1.4 trillion won in 2008 to 3.5 trillion won by the same year.

But I didn't have any pencils so I had to go to near petrol. They doesn't sell it. At that time I realized that I had some pencils in my bag. I found them but I couldn't find my pencil sharperner. So I decided to only read the book. But suddenly the washing machine said my laundry had been finished washing. So I had to hang them on outside. And I was hungry. I cooked foods and ate. My friends came to my house so we talked together. Now I am so tired.. Maybe you would say, 'you can study now!' Well.. with all due respect, I am so tired I just want to take a rest.

There are a lot of the internet website to make new friends such as facebook, twitter and so on these days. They each have a purpose. I also use the internet like this. In my case, I want to study another language, so I use it to make foreign friends. However if you meet someone who you met on the internet in person, I advise you not to meet them. Although you think you know a lot of things about them, they may have hidden their identity to cheat you. Finally, it depends on how you think."

Because I can borrow video tapes and buy some foods at low price. However, if I go to a theater to watch a movie, I spend lots of fees such as expensive movie ticket, popcorn and transportation cost. Second, It is very comfortable to watch a movie at home. When I watch a movie at theater, I should only sit down at the allocated chair. On the other hand, we can change our pose at home freely. For these reasons, I prefer to watch a movie at home."

Vietnamese,"The Computer Nowadays,with the development of the technology,computer plays an important role in our life. As for me,it is not only a tool to learn,but also a way to entertain. At first,computer is an open library with many fields of knowledge,which will enable you do research in whatever you want. For example, if you want to study about Japanese culture,you only need to use google search tool and type the keyword ""Japanese culture"" and then you can learn by yourself. Moreover,there are many direct training programes through internet. So,you can enjoy studying at your own house. It is very convenient. Besides,when you are free,you can use computer to entertain. Computer provides you many various kinds of entertainment such as games,television or radio online... To me, I often play some funny games when I feel tired, I also browse web for new news or chat with my friends. With computer I can contact to my friends all over the world,as well as access to news improvements. I also can watch the latest famous films or movies from my room... It is clear that,computer is an essential mean to help me in my study and entertainment as well."

Even though there are many adverse opinions in this character, no one can dissent that she is the vividly image of independent women who dare to fight for happiness and get what her wants. One can censure her selfishness or her childishness but who can stop a heart desires for love, even in fact what she pursued is just a big illusion of love? Who can prohibit that astute woman from living her life her own way?"

Thank to them for letting me know how responsible I should take because if I hurt myself or detroy it for any reasons, it means I hurt my folks, who love me more than themself thousand times. They give me lessons that no one can do. Teaching me know how deep and strong the homesickness is when I am away from them.

Thank to my parent who cant afford buying for me costly cars, motobikes, or provide me with luxury things but teach me how confident I should be when I just wear normal T-shirt and jeans and canvas shoes between people who wear dress that cost more than three month salary of my part-time job. Sometimes, I may be shocked by standing on the elavator, and see a woman with high-bred style and carrying a trade-making handbag, but then, I am calm, look at my non brand handbag and tell mysefl that my big bag is number one, I can hold many a thing on that. Thank to my parents who sometimes make me unplesant by stopping me from working something with my childish price and let me realize that there are many seducements that just want me to fall deeply into black hole and I gotta be careful with them. Thank to my parens who are always in silence when I am angry and just complain about nonsencal things but the silence is enough to let me know that I am not right. Thank to my parents who seems behind the times. However it makes me love them more because they have not been spending time in discovering new things just because taking care of me, my brother and sisters. Thank to my parents who always listen to my feelings even though I can't do the same for them. Thank to my parents who teach me not know how to keep my tears when I witness heart-breaking scene, teach me how to sympathize and open my heart up for who are not lucky like me. Thank for teaching me know that no pain, no gain. Thank for forgiving my every mistakes but let me know how reproachable it is if knowing something is wrong but still do it. Thank you so much my folks for loving me like no one can love, more than I love myself, thank for many thing that I will never be able to tell all even I really would like to do it. I really wanna say all these things to you but I am too and just because i know that whether I say to you these words or not, you will always love me like ever.

Vietnamese,"examinations Yet, some people argue that examinations make students work hard. At first, examinations help teachers to evaluate what their students has gained from courses so students really want to show how well they are by working hard for the exams to get high grades. Examinations are so good chances for students to express themselves. In addition, examinations also give students a motive to work hard as they donâ€™t wish to fall behind their friends. But if the students receive nothing back other than the grades, the real value of examinations is practically wiped out. Making the grade is personally rewarding and is an important basis for special awards (like scholarships), admission to advanced trainings and employment prospects also, as a result, students work harder and harder. On the whole, examination is the very thing that motivates students to work hard."

Vietnamese,"My essay :d it is about problems that newcomers must face whee they first come to live in another country. Problematic Tribulations of Newcomers Have you ever imagined about problems that newcomers might face when they get a removal to another country? It would be a terrified situation to be in for people who arrive and stay in a new place. There are many troubles that may break us down. The language, the money, and the homesickness are several typical difficulties that Iâ€™m talking about. First of all, the most imperative element for foreigners that I believe is the language. No matter who we are, where we live, and what we do, we need to know language to communicate. If we live in a country without speaking the language, we will be merely worthless people because in fact, we canâ€™t do anything easily. Itâ€™s like a firm barrier that separates all of us from native speakers. Then weâ€™ll get in trouble of relationship. No talking makes our life almost covered by darkness and depression. For examples, you can go to school but you canâ€™t make any friend or understand lectures in classes. Letâ€™s suppose you are a high school student. How would you feel when all students keep laughing endlessly just because youâ€™re not able to understand anything and you get a wrong, baby response for teacherâ€™s question? Furthermore, when you have to find a job or need to go to hospital, and when you get lost while going out, what would you do with no speaking and listening skill? Oh my god!!! How terrible! In conclusion, there are lots of problematical things affect newcomers for the first time theyâ€™ve lived in a new country. Those difficulties are just hurdles that needed to be overcome. There is only one advice for everyone: â€œDonâ€™t move from a country to another one without considering carefully, you need to come prepare. At least, your will must be filled by determination, energy and courage, not feebleness â€“ for sure!â€ I havent done it yet. but i hope is will be correct ^^ by all of you!!!"
Vietnamese,"Ways to improve your English speaking skill Hi, i'm English learner. My writing below have many mistakes, i hope you'll help me, thank you so much. English is becoming a popular language in the world but one of difficult things with English learner is speaking skill. How to speak english fluently is the hard question to answer and i think there are some tips which will help learners to improve speaking skill: practice with yourself and with others. It can be denied that practicing English with yourself is very essential. Some people may think that learning foreign language is studying grammar and vocabulary. it's the wrong thing! If they only learn grammar and vocabulary, they absolutely don't know how to speak with English. It is the reason why you should notice to practice speaking everyday. Trying to speak words correctly and clearly in front of the mirror is the useful way. Further more, learners have to improve this skill by talking around some specific topics such as: politic, education, music. If they are addicted to English songs, they can listen songs, try to write lyrics and sing follow the singers. However, practicing with foreigners and other learners is not a bad method. Some clubs were established to help English learners. They are the wonderful places to practice speaking skill and reactive ability. In my country, one of the famous club is FA. FA helps a large number of students and pupils to speak english fluently by working in groups. Speaking is one of the important skill with learner. Trying to practing with yourself and others to improve this skil is the beneficial method."

The best way to throw away the tiredness and enjoy a coming spring is to dip in a warm water bath, massage and relax. 5. End up projects You have lots of work to do but try to end them up as soon as possible. Do not let these ones overlap the other ones. 6. Spending time for your children Time that passed away cannot come back. So spend time to take care your children and talk and play with them. Either your children or you can feel the warm atmosphere in your family. 7. Warm your love. Try to make a change. Let give some recipe to your love by preparing a surprising dinner with candles and flowers, make up beautifully and dress sharply before falling into your mate's arms.

It was so memoreble for me as well as my classmates. There is a truthful, excilent boy in my class. He sent messages to all class that were about the French teacher was sick so the class would postpone to the next day. When the message came, I was sleeping, I just read and felt a bit happy because I feel lazy to go to class. I continue sleeping as natural flextion without doubt. After a few minutes, one of my classmate called to ask about the postpone. She was in doubt because she remembered that day was the fool's day. I thought she maybe right but I know that the boy is so truthful,it was impposible that he lied on us. I told my friend to not doubt too much. after ending the call, I received some messages from other students with the same questions about the postpone. I feel doubt and call the boy, He amswered the call with a voice like he was sleeping. He said see me on the next day. My all doubt disappeared. I left the bed and turned my laptop on to read some news. At 6:45, He sent me a message that was:"" happy fool's day, wake up and come to the class my dears friends"". I was suprised and prepared quik to come the class. I tried my best to do anything as fast as possible but I was still late for ten minutes, I also met other classmates at the parking-lot. Haha, they were lied the same me. when we came the class, there were just the French teacher and the most truthful boy who were waiting for remaning students. The teacher were not angry at us, on the contrary, he just smiled and told us to take a sit,then he wrote down on the board:"" poisson d'avril"". Well, no one could say anything, just looked at each other and we started lesson happily. Such a fool's day!!!"
Vietnamese,"10th entry: ""In your opinion, why people raise money for charity? Have you ever done anything to raise money for charity?"" There are plenty of reasons raising money for charity. The most important reason is sharing luck to the Poor. As you know, Our social is developing rapidly, thus the living cost also increase quickly. As the result, the poor people are very hard to survive. People ready to give a hand to the poor who really needs our helps. Some people have a strong believe that, if we help someone right now, we will get more in the future. This belief has proved for many years. It is the truth, when we give charity to help the poor, we feels happy ourself. I also do charity whenever I have chance. Actually we have a charity fund in our company, each staff will become a member for contributing this fund. we always help the poor, especially children who have no chance to study. We help them by providing a the necessaries things like cloths, food and books as well. In my opinion, do charity is not always by giving money to the poor. As student we can do a thing such as spend time to the poor, working at charity organization. The more we give the more we gain. This is the fair life. I am looking forward to receive your valuable corrections or spend time for it. Thanks & Best regards!"
Vietnamese,"BAMBOO DRAGONFLY- A GREAT SOUVENIR FROM VIETNAM This is my very first post on my hometown, Vietnam and Vietnamese culture. Even though my English is not very good and surely not as beautiful as what I am trying to describe, I hope that it would at least help those who have interest in cultures and Vietnam to know more about my beloved hometown. ^^ 1st episode: BAMBOO DRAGONFLY- A GREAT SOUVENIR FROM VIETNAM What is a bamboo dragonfly? - Simple answer: Itâ€™s a dragonfly made from bamboo. What is so special about it? - Letâ€™s see, itâ€™s cheap, but handmade, beautiful, colorful, well- designed andâ€¦ â€œcan flyâ€ on anything ^^ Amazing isnâ€™t it? :) A red dragonfly lands on my finger :) A red dragonfly lands on my finger :) Actually, they canâ€™t â€œflyâ€ like the real ones but as long as you know how to do it right, place them wherever you like, they would land on it, and â€œflyâ€ around it as the wind blows. As long as a bamboo dragonflyâ€™s beak is on a specific surface or point, it would never fall, just like a real one. How are they made? - Simply speaking, they are TOTALLY handmade from bamboo. These dragonflies are made from tough and insect-proof bamboo from places like HoÌ€a BiÌ€nh, HaÌ€ Giang in northern Vietnam. It looks simple but the making process is very complicated and sophisticated. The body and the wings are crafted separately, then the wings are attached to the body by plugging into very small holes on the bodyâ€™s sides. After that, the craftsman have to place the dragonfly on a chopstickâ€™s head to test its balance ability. Adjustment would be made until the bamboo dragonfly can balance perfectly on its beak. Afterward, the craftsman uses a little clue to make sure the wings would not come apart. They are then dried under the sun and finally painted with different color and design. Itâ€™s actually a very sophisticated process since the craftsman has to calculate the length and width of the body as well as the wings very carefully so that the bamboo dragonfly can fly. The decorating process is also very time- consuming as the dragonfly is usually small. However, they are sold with very reasonable price. Itâ€™s only about 2.000 VND to 10.000 VND per bamboo dragonfly. Available in almost all color, from small to big size. And available in many places from big book stores to street vendors. (if lucky, you can find some bamboo butterflies too ^^) Hope you can find your own beautiful Vietnamese bamboo dragonfly! ^^ These are some pages where you can read about bamboo dragonfly in Vietnamese: http://blog.yume.vn/xem-blog/chuon-chuon-tre-mon-qua-tuoi-tho.sontran155.35CE40C3.html http://baodatviet.vn/Home/congdongviet/Nguoi-chap-canh-cho-chuon-chuon-tre-Thach-Xa/200910/62123.datviet And this is a Japanese TV program about Vietnamese bamboo dragonfly ^^ (in Japanese for sure :) ) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRCFheUOP0A&feature=player_embedded Hope you enjoy it! ^^ Fly Vietnam!

Vietnamese,"Essay:Smoking Topic: Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: ""Smoking should be allowed in public places"" Although smokers have right to consider cigarette as a useful method to reduce the pressure or stress of work or life, they have to know that smoking has negative affect on their own health and everyone around them. In my opinion, I think that smoking should be banned in public places. There are three reasons to convince me to agree with the idea that banning smoking in public. First of all, most of people in community understand clearly that smoking harms to our health seriously. Not only the smokers but also people who breathe smoking can get dangerous diseases such as lung cancer, mouth cancer, especially early death. Following the recent research, women who smoke regularly can lead to be childless after being married or children's brain can be affected badly. Despite its clear disadvantages, a large number of people continue smoking in offices, companies or hospitals. They have total right for their life to kill their own life if continuing smoking, however, they can not force everyone to breathe poisonous smoke like them. Second, I want to talk about the issue of money. Smokers will waste much money buying cigarettes to satisfy their thirsty. Let's imagine how much money they can save without smoking. If everyday you spend five dollar on cigarettes, every months you will spend one hundreds fifty dollar and every year you will spend huge money. Instead of that, smokers should save the money to build a happy family or so on. Finally, my thinking consists of many potential hazards. Smoking can lead the air pollution and many problems of environment. In addition, smoking is the reason for fired building. Sometimes, smokers put out the cigarette carelessly or throw it away on the streets. It can lead the fire that nobody expects and impact on society. In sum, I think that smoking should be banned in public places to protect people's health from the poisonous smoke."

Vietnamese,"Foreign languages Hello everybody! Yesterday I started to learn Korean on the internet. I just learnt alphabet. Itâ€™s said that because the Korean grammar is similar to the Japaneseâ€™s, so that the Korean who study Japanese just have to take about 1year to speak Japanese fluently, while the other foreigners have to take 3,4 years or more than so . I want to try to study both Korean and Japanese at a same time. Is it alright? I found that the Koreanâ€™s alphabet is easier to write than the Japaneseâ€™s. How about the way of spell? Iâ€™m always not patient enough to take a self-study for a long time. cozâ€™ Iâ€™m a lazy girl. But I hope this time Iâ€™ll study at least until I can write an entry introduce myself in Korean. ^_^ All the â€œsenpaiâ€ (^^) please help me with your experiences. I like to learn foreign languages, especially English. But my English is so poor even though Iâ€™ve learnt it for ~10 years. And after I entered the Japanese department, I even canâ€™t recall any Englishâ€™s grammars that Iâ€™d learnt before. I think English is most important. If I can speak both English and Japanese, Iâ€™ll have more chances to have a good job in the future. But itâ€™s also said that itâ€™s very difficult to learn well both of them. When I studied Japanese for a short time, I often confused English and Japanese. One time, I had an Japanese examination. We had to test 4 skills: listening, speaking, writing, reading. At the time of speakingâ€™s skill, a Japanese teacher asked me a question in Japanese. The answer came to my mind in Vietnamese and then I nearly to spoke it out in English. (the question was about my family. when I want to say â€œThereâ€™re 4 people in my family. They are: father, mother, sister and I. I almost said that â€œã€‚ã€‚ çˆ¶ã¨æ¯ã¨å§‰ã¨â€œmeâ€â€).. Especially, the Japaneseâ€™s katakana are almost took form from English, right? But the way of speaking is different. The Japanese who see a katakana word just spell it normally but we who had learnt English before when see a katakana word, we just try to think of an English word and then spell it. For this reason, we found it difficult to spell katakana, especially when we see a katakana word that doesnâ€™t come from English, or the name of places and people. An essay which has too many katakana words always makes me bored. I like English very much but I chose the Japanese department for no reasons. When I had to fill in the university entrance examinationâ€™s admission form, I even didnâ€™t know what I want to do in the future and who I want to be. Then I asked my brother for an advice, he said that â€œI like Japanese. You should choose Japanese department. If you can win a scholarship for a Japaneseâ€™s university, I can ask you to buy me something in Japan.â€œ. I knew he was just joking but I chose it simply. ^_^. He isnâ€™t my own brother. I was acquainted with him in a Chineseâ€™s room chat when I was at 9th grade about 4 years ago. He is very special person, even though weâ€™ve met in real life yet. He is 8 years older than me but he just likes a friend. He is very humorious and handsome >_<. He can always make me smile even when Iâ€™m in bad mood. â€¦ That is the reason why I didnâ€™t choose English department despite I like it best. But in my university, at the second year of regular training, we can choose a second qualifications if we want and sure that weâ€™ll be able to study well both. My university has about 11 foreign languageâ€™s departments and some other department where teach economics, travel bussiness, computer and so onâ€¦ If weâ€™re learning a foreign language, weâ€™re advised to choose the economics or travel bussinessâ€™s department so that when we graduate we will have a best job. But If we want to study another foreign language, itâ€™s ok. So next year, I intend to choose English department for the second qualifications. And when weâ€™re at the third year, we have a compulsory subject. This is called â€œsecond foreign languageâ€. Itâ€™s differ from the second qualifications. Because the second qualifications also has economics, travel bussiness, computerâ€¦ training and it isnâ€™t compulsory. The second foreign language is called compulsory subject but we can choose any foreign language to study. For example, Iâ€™m learning Japanese, I have to choose one in 10 other foreign languages remained. So, if next year I choose the English department, the year after I maybe choose Korean for second foreign language. The compulsory subject just has 300 sections. Itâ€™s too little to learn almost the language we choose. To learn almost Japanese, we have 4 years. After that, itâ€™s not sure that we can be able to speak it fluently. So I want to try to study Korean right now. I also like French too. It sounds lovely. Itâ€™s called â€œloveâ€™s languageâ€, isnâ€™t it? If I have more spare time, I want to learn French. >_< Do you know our Uncle Ho who was able to speak fluently more than 10 foreign languages? I canâ€™t do like that but I wish I could learn at least 4: Japanese, English, Korean and French. Do you think it is alright? Do I have the ability to do?? No ones know but nothing is impossible. ^_^ Iâ€™m going to have an end-of-term examination this month. Iâ€™m very worry about it. This time we still have to test 4 Japaneseâ€™s skill. Iâ€™m very nervous of speaking and listening skill. The result of last term, both 3 skills (listening, reading, writing), I got good marks (9,5/10 each skill), but I just took 7,5/10 the speaking skill in spite of my easy topic. And the middle-term examination, my listening skillâ€™s mark was 5,5/10. It was so bad, wasnâ€™t it?And the essayâ€™s topic this time will be random. Iâ€™ll have to write anything in Japanese as topicâ€™s request. It seems to be more difficult than last term examinations. Time is so fast, isnâ€™t it? Next year I will be a â€œsenpaiâ€. >_< Time waits for no one. And life is short. We have no way except one way. This is try hard! Anyway, next year is 2010. Ha Noi will celebrate an anniversary for 1000 years of Thang Long- Ha Noi. It seems to be a big anniversary. Ha Noi welcomes all of you. We set a countdown clock near Hoan Kiemâ€™s Lake. Itâ€™s counting down everyday... I posted 3 pictures: my special-brotherâ€™s, the countdown clockâ€™s and a picture I took with my close friend. It was edited so much by photoshop (it looks beautiful but not real ^^). Write about ""photoshop"", It recalls me a friendâ€™s sentence â€œI wish I could â€œphotoshopâ€ all my memories...â€... The photo is taken 2 years ago. We wore wedding dress despite the absence of our bridegrooms.>_< Next time, Iâ€™ll try to translate this entry into Japanese. I think itâ€™s difficult for me to do... In this entry, the sentences I used are all simple sentences, it looks long... But I think it has a lot of mistakes."

Vietnamese,"Gá»i Cuá»‘n, Vietnamese food, one of the most fifty dilicious food in the world! Today, after finishing the physical class, our group went to eat Gá»i Cuá»‘n, one of the most fifty delicious food in the world. Although it is delicious, it is unexpensive and it is popular with people in the south of Vietnam, especially students. Its ingredients include rice vermicelli, shrimp, spring onions, girdle cake, and some pork. The ingredients seem so simple, but when it combines to each other, the taste is so nice. Most of foreigners who come to Vietnam for working or travelling like Gá»i Cuá»‘n. They said that it has a special taste that is easy to eat and they enjoy it a lot. Once, we take our foreign teacher and her friends to eat Gá»i Cuá»‘n, and after trying it, they told us that Gá»i Cuá»‘n is so delicious, they would like to learn how to make Gá»i Cuá»‘n. After a few days, we got together and we tauch them how to roll this special food. First, they rolled and Gá»i Cuá»‘n that they did looks funny. Just a few minutes then when they were aware of making Gá»i Cuá»‘n, they did it faster and beautiful as well. We could see how happy they were when they finished each product. Finally, we went to the beach and enjoyed it together! We took alot of pictures to save emotional moments. Gá»i Cuá»‘n is not only delicious, but also helps us be closer. I like Gá»i Cuá»‘n... Am I promoting for one of Vietnamese food? No, I just tell the tuth. Haha. If you have a chance to travel to Vietnam, just try Gá»i Cuá»‘n, you will know how taste one of the most fifty delicious food in the world is!!!

Vietnamese,"COFFEE I love drinking coffee. I love its bitter taste which is left in my mouth. Sometimes I drink it every day. Regular drinking forms my â€œhabitâ€. Regular habit forms my â€œaddictionâ€. Regular addiction forms the only image of coffee in my eyes, and the only name coming from my mouth whenever I enter a coffee shop with my friends. For me, coffee has a natural and obvious place in my life... However, each morning passed with only coffee made me bored. I tried changing my drink. Lemon tea became my new â€œpartnerâ€. Its sour-sweet taste was quite different with coffeeâ€™s. My tongue gradually forgot those bitter drops. I realized that I didnâ€™t love coffee as much as I had thought. My mouth could call another names out of â€œcoffeeâ€. I really thought I could leave coffee... [... ] Therefore, my tongue misses that bitter taste, my nose searches for the familiar smell, and my mouth bursts into â€œcoffeeâ€ again... Each sense and each cell in my body seem to say that â€œI want coffee!â€ ...

Vietnamese,"Autumn Festival Today, I woke up earlier than normal. On my way to the office, I noticed at the end of one street corner, a shopkeeper was setting up a stall, which used to display moon cakes. Time goes so fast.. another Mid- autumn festival is upcomming. In August and September, Vietnamese people celebrate two great festivals:The Vu lan festival(also known as the Amnesty of Unquiet Spirits) and the Mid- autumn festival. During these days,many people attend to pagodas,praying for their passed mothers, feeding to the homeless souls. It's also the occasion for those,who is living away from home, gather together,express their gratefulness to their parents and accestors by making a feast, burning joss paper and incensing in front of the house. As I was a child,I was very scared of these days. Adults told me that on the Vu Lan festival,the gates of hell was opened to let the tormented souls out,they were hungry ghosts and wandered along the street,looking for a naughty kids to eat. I was in fright so much that I did not dare to show off my face in the road at night as well as day and other child at my ages did not either. As I grow up, I have just thoroughly acknowleaged the meaning of Vu Lan festival. It's valuable tradition should be kept to next our generation."

Vietnamese,"Legend of St. Giong (part 2) The enemies came to the foot of Buffalo mountain. The country was in danger, everybody was panicked (I want to use the word ""perilous"" instead of ""danger"", but I don't know how to write the sentence). Just at the moment, the messenger brought the iron horse, rod and armor to the boy. The boy rose up and turned into/became a stately knight who is over 4.7 meters tall. He slapped on the back of the horse. The horse whinnied/neighed long and thunderously. The knight wore the iron armor and then take the whip and jumped on his horse. The horse vomited fire, Giong pushed his horse to gallop to the enemies. He waited in front for them, killed them off one layer to another/ from this class to other classes, the enemies died as chicken pox. Suddenly, the rod was broken. Giong immediately pulled up clusters of bamboo on the sides of street beat against the enemies. They were smashed/broken. Remnants of the army trampled upon each other to escape. The knight drove them into the foot of Soc mountain. He went to the top of the mountain, took off his armor and flew into the sky with the horse. To honor his great service, the King confered Phu Dong Thien Vuong on him and built a temple for him. Nowadays, the temple still remains in Phu Dong village, which is often called Giong village. Every year in April, the inhabitants organize a big festival. People say that clusters of bamboo in Gia Binh district are saffron (The color is not saffron, but it's kinda similar to that) because the horse vomited fire to them and the footprint of the horse made ponds and lakes constantly. People also say that when Giong's horse vomited fire, the fire destroyed a whole village and that's why the village was called Fire village."

Vietnamese,"I realized that I am not good at my mother tongue! Yesterday, we had a tranlating class and it was exciting for us. However, new things always make us confused and I really realise some facts that seems simple but I have ever thought about. In the class, we learnd how to translate texts from English into Vietnamses and do it by contrary. So far, when I read something in English, I can understand them if they are on fields that we have been tauch. However, to tell others what the English texts are about in Vietnamese is so hard. I can understand what they are about but the problem I have is I don't know which words I should use to translate into Vietnamese. That is because my mother tongue is not good. Honestly, in some fiels such as stock market, speciaized term's economy, and so on. There are many words that I don't understand even they are vietnamese. So if I am not good at my original language, it will be more difficult if I wanna be good at other lanuages. My classmates also have the same problem like me. Finding our problem, our teacher gave us some advices. He told us that we should read news in varieties of fields to improve our Vietnamese and enlarge our vocabulary. I think he is completely right. I will try to do it! Thank you for reading!"
Vietnamese,"Job security and salary should be based on ""employee performance"" vs ""years service"" (my writing for GMAT practice) Salary is considered as awards for employees for their contribution to one company. Some people think that salary should be paid base on the years of service, the time they have contributed to the company. But I myself strongly think that employees should be given the salary accordance with their performance at work. First of all, as my experiences in working for Japanese company, where salary is mainly based on long time service, I find that the employees have tend not try to find out the best way or the easiest way to finish the works. They believe that they merely work for one position of a company for long time, their salary will be higher year by year. On the other hand, if the salary is paid due to the performance of the employees, they would find out the most effective way to fulfill the task. This also saves time, and costs down for production. Thus, company can get much more profit and the salary for employees can be higher for the next year. The employees themselves can become more active and a fair competitive working-environment can be created in the company. However, long time service salary can keep the employees working for one company for a long time. This is very important, especially for the experts of the company, because the time for training one person from beginning to become a skilled one is very long and it took much hard-working. Anyway, a company, which attract employees by the salary policy based on good performance, can easily employ good skilled personnel and experts. Of all the reason I have stated above, I believe that the employees should be paid for what they have done and contributed, not for how long they have been in service for the company."

Vietnamese,"English, A long Journey In my opinion, English is as difficult as others, the difficulty belongs to how we study. Because someone has their own study strategies different from others, so their levels are different too. I have been studying English for two years. However, my strategy is nothing, it seems that i study naturally. I read English magazines and try to remember vocabulary and verb collusion then. sometimes, i write essays and post them up to some grammatical correction websites then, it is really interesting if i receive some feedback that could be complements or complaints for my mistakes. I nerve mind if i write mistakes because i know after that i will get some useful experiences. in Addition to reading, I usually listen to English teaching lessons a BBC. com, i try to catch what they speak and now i can understand a little. I think the difficulty is how long we spend on studying English. I hope you all will give me some advices. Thank you for reading this entry and looking forward to your advices."

Vietnamese,"Do people learn more from losing than from winning? Plan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations. I really like the issues related to winning and losing. Perhaps, there are some people who think that losing means â€œthe endâ€. But I do not think so. Everyone know that as winning in a game we feel happy. But probably not everyone realizes the fact that we can learn a lot from losing. Here I want to say in the broader sense, that is failure. Maybe you think this is silly, but I always believe that it is true. Imagine that you are walking in the street. Unfortunately, you trip over a stone, and fall down. You hurt. Immediately, you seek to reduce pain, then try to stand up. And you do not forget to remind yourself that next time must walk more carefully. A question arises : â€œWould you remind yourself if you did not stumble ?â€. Maybe no. The stumbling helped you do more correctly. If you did not tripped, you would not hurt. Of course you would not note this, and you would not be careful. Failures in our life are the same as stumbling on a stone. After a failure, you feel depressed, fretful. You want this will not happen again. You think a lot about it, you find out your mistake. You draw a lesson from this, and will not make that mistake anymore. Moreover, when you get a trouble, you will find the way to overcome it. You know you have to act otherwise. When you stumble, you have to be careful. When you do an exercise wrong, you have to do it again. When you lose, you have to change tactics. And you will be better. For instance, you get a bad result on your math test. You change your learning method, go out less. You plan to study math. Everyday you do a lot of exercises, ask a friend to help you in math. You try a lot. Some time later, you study math better. Thus, failure makes you try harder, become stronger, and you will do better, as the review in the book â€œBeing a happy teenagerâ€ by Andrew Matthews. Failure or losing also helps us to know more about ourselves, thereby we chose the other way which suitable for us. For example : I attended the Japanese singing contest in Sakura Festival this April. I sang so badly, so I was eliminated. And I realized that I canâ€™t sing. Perhaps Iâ€™m better at drawing, because I always get 10 marks in art at school. You may also know : President Lincoln has failed in business for 2 times, failed in election for 8 times. And after 30 years of effort, he was elected the 16th president, and is one of the greatest presidents in history of the United States. Basketball superstar Micheal Jordan was cut from high school basketball team because of his ""lack of skill"". Our famous American film producer, director, screenwriter, voice actor, and animator â€“ Walt Disney, was ridiculed by a newspaper editor because he had no good idea in film production. We all see what they have done. But they succeeded not because they were lucky, that because they made efforts. They did better after their failures, therefore they succeeded. People often say : â€œFailure is the mother of successâ€. This is true everywhere in the world. For instance, we Vietnamese say : â€œTháº¥t báº¡i lÃ máº¹ thÃ nh cÃ´ngâ€. Japanese people have an similar idiom: â€œShippai wa seikou no motoâ€, that means â€œFailure is the origin of successâ€. Personally, I think it is correct. So, when you fail, you not only receive the suffering but you learn more from losing than you think. Losing is not the end, losing is the beginning if we take the advantage of its beneficial sides."

Vietnamese,"Education Vietnam is developing country, therefore there are many problems emerged in society such as air pollution, overloaded transportations, the decline of infrastructure qualities.. etc but I think the most urgent matter, which the goverment has to deal with is the lack of housing for students Every years, at the begining of July, there are thousands of students come to Ha Noi, the capital city of Vietnam, attending to the unniversity examinations. They mostly come from red rive delta region or central coast. They bring with them the expectations of families, friends, teachers. They have no idea about front challenges. First of all, it is housing problem The severe lacks of housing for students can be reffered as the percentage of the number's students in doorm above the number's students in total. This statistic is less then 30%. Therefore, 70% of students has to find accommodations by themselves. As a certain result, most of their accommodations are dirty, unsecure and extremely faraway from the unniversities.( In Ha Noi, the major of number's universities are located in centre, the price of rent estate very high compared to student's income). This nightmare will not ends until the day they'd graduate, work, marry and have their own children, except they'd get the huge financial support from their families. Workers have also encounted the same situation. This problem has been exitting for many years. But Recently, I've heard from the public media, one of the goverment's spokeman said"" will move the metropolitan unniversities to the suburbs"". I do not know how longer it becomes true. Now,we have to wait"
Vietnamese,"toelf writing ""We should not judge people by their external appearances"" I absolutely agree with this and I guess you have the same idea. That is because two main reason. First, human being is a very special one. You and I have many respects to consider not only external appearances. If you judge me just by my external appearances, you will never understand me even we are never friend. Second, the most important thing people have is human dignity not appearances. It is too wrong to judge people by appearances. You can be misleading by attractive faces, but maybe they are killer. Some people, however, are so ugly, they are admired by their prestige. For instance Truong Vo Diem, Bao Chuanâ€¦ Inclusion, the first statement is always true because of that two reason. You should be careful when judge people."

Vietnamese,"Western comic vs Japanese manga Another paragraph writing. I'm doing my best to improve my writing skill, so I really aprreciate your comment on word choice, grammar, etc. anything that you think it's not okay. Thank you! Western comics and Japanese mangas have major differences in art style, book format and creating process. First, manga drawing tends to exaggerate peopleâ€™s appearances with rather big eyes, unique hairstyle and exceptional clothes. On the contrary, comics have a realistic style, making the characters look as much like real people as possible. Second, all of mangasâ€™ pages are black and white, whereas comic books are printed in color. Third, despite a few number of assistants, mangakas (mangasâ€™ authors) do most of the work themselves, including constructing the plot and drawing. Conversely, lots of people are involved in the manufacturing process of the comics-writer, colorist, inker, penciler to name a few. In conclusion, regardless of those contrarieties, both mangas and comics are doing a very good job at entertaining people from all over the world."

In VietNam, eating custom was evaluated mixed and special. VietNam is the country has long history and mixed custom. Many years ago, this country was colonised by China, France, Japan and America. That is the reason which created the complex eating custom in VietNam. In capital, the popular eating custom in public is in the market. Market has a great deal of stocks with many kinds of good, on the other hand, it is the place which gather small restaurants. The common structure of these restaurants are built without roof or wall, they look like tents with big tables and seats inside. But, they're favourite places for women to discuss family talks. In some formal places, people eating in big, glamorous restaurant like western countries. When going home, they eat with family and talk about social news. Eating custom in VietNam is very special. The most different thing in eating custom is always included 3 meals and lunch, dinner are the important meals in a day. Meals in VietNam have to have rice, soup and some dishes. They don't like food have origin from industry. Natural food is more acceptable and favourite."

Vietnamese,"The best way of getting round Hanoi Hanoi is a noisy city with busy streets. The traffic is terrible especially in rush hour. So I think using bus is the best way of getting round the city. First of all, travelling by bus is cheap. You only have to pay a small amount of money for buying ticket instead of a big amount of money for gasoline (if you use a motorbike). It was even cheaper if you were a commutation ticket holder. In comparison with travelling by motorbike, travelling by bus is much cheaper. Furthermore, if you travel by bus, you don't have to wait in line to buy a parking ticket or pay a fine because you went through a red light, or were riding without a safety helmet, too. As a student, I think using the bus as daily means of transport is a good way to save money. Secondly, I think travelling by bus is safe. When you use the bus, you can avoid accidents. As you know, a large number of people get into motorbike accidents every year. A lot of people even die or are seriously injured in the accidents. I used to see some terrible bike accidents so maybe travellling by bus is safer. In addition, many people feel safer when travel by bus where there are lots of people. Anyway, it is not a good idea to go to everywhere alone. Finally, travelling by bus helps to protect your health. The traffic in rush hour is so terrible, it make everyone tired. Traffic dirt and dust is make you feel suffocated. Therefore, it's a good idea to take the bus to avoid damaging your health. Besides, when the weather is bad - too hot or too cold - choosing the bus for travelling is sensible. For example, in winter, even if you wear lots of layers of clothes, gloves, wool hat, you will probably catch a cold, sneeze, get a runny nose if you ride bike a long way. Sometimes, the bus is not on time and you have to wait at the bus stop for a long time. The bus can be also be very crowded. But now, I think the bus service is improving, getting better, safer. So I think using bus is the best way of getting round the city."
Vietnamese,"it's raining again It's raining again, right now outside the window. In just 5 minutes, the sky turn totally dark.

When my parents came back,we enjoyed the meal and had warm talk. The next day,my younger sister also came back from school. I was always looking forward to meeting her for a long time. I was very happy. I offered her a small gift that I had prepared. Later,I asked her about the school,the class and friends. She told me many interesting stories.

Vietnamese,"prison health care Prisonerâ€™s health care service has approached way so high than the Californianâ€™s. California government has spent billions of dollars providing better health care for those that have broken the rules than for the thousands of innocents who canâ€™t afford insurance. â€œStates spend 10 percent of their corrections budgets on average to cover the cost of inmate health care â€“ a total of over $3 billion annually,â€ Sunny Kaplan proclaims. (Kaplan) For example, On September 18, 1995, Horacio Alberto Reyes-Camarena, 47 year old murderer who killed 18-year-old, deserved a kidney transplant which cost the state an additional $100,000, so that he would be able to stay healthy until the date of his execution. Before of his kidney transplant the state of Oregon pays $121,000 a year to keep him on dialysis (Robinson). What makes government pay for this cost is because of the correctional institutions. â€œCorrectional institutions are legally required to provide the same medical care to prisoners as that available to the publicâ€” including preventative care, care for chronic conditions, and mental treatmentâ€ (Sonle). However, it is negligible for the state to be paying for such outrageous procedures to keep alive a man who has been sentence to die. California also plans spending $8 billion over the next five years to build seven advanced medical facilities for inmates throughout the state. It is not acceptable that criminals who have committed crimes worth of the death penalty receive transplants and advanced treatments ahead of others. In conclusion, health care spending per inmate rose from $7,601 per inmate in 2005-06 to $13,778 per inmate in 2007-08 â€“ about 81 percent increase and far above the average of $4,600 spent on health care per Californian. Therefore, there are bunch of people would go bankrupt from the medical costs of fighting cancer whereas the offenders receive expensive treatment for their health. â€œOncology clinics often see prisoners get life-saving medical treatment while turning away other people who could not get treatment because their insurance wouldnâ€™t pay for it. Prisoners donâ€™t have to worry thatâ€ (Stancliff). How pathetic that the Supreme Court will mandate health insurance for prisoner, and not the hard-working people of this nation who pay taxes. California budgets are used to pay for prisonerâ€™s health care rather than for Californianâ€™s health care and education. â€œState Attorney General Jerry Brown told the press the court receiverâ€™s proposal was â€˜the most extravagant proposal for prison health care weâ€™ve ever seen in the United Statesâ€™â€ (Stancliff). Keeping prisoner healthy is the top of the governmentâ€™s considered even though this offender has made our society dangerously situation. Hence, California is suggested as a highest state of the prison healthcare cost. Moreover, the $13,778 health-care-per-inmate cost is just for the general offenders, and the cost will probably get higher when the prisoners get older."

Also those who became Green Summer soldiers at least one time, wore the Green Summer T-shirt, I truly believe that no one will forget that days; the day with many hardships but brimming with joys, laughter and feelings that cannot write in words. I am not the exception, the Green Summer has left strange memories which will be in my heart forever; but maybe if I am not a Green Summer soldier, I would never have been."

Because we live far from our family, I have responsible to take care her. My father always expect me to take care her, I cannot reject this mission. If I am not living with her now, actually I don't care what she wants to do. Unluckily we meet everyday. I know how much she sad, but I have to do in this situation. I prefer become hard person at the moment rather than comfortable person. Most of people like comfortable teacher rather than strict teacher. In the future they may remind and said themselves. I wish, If I have chance, or regret for everything has gone. Anyway I am a strict person right now. I have to do even I don't want, because of a promising with my father. I am strict person, am I?

Vietnamese,"After a fieldtrip The one-day fieldtrip at Hoa An center was not long but what I received from it is remarkable. In fact, traveling broadens oneâ€™s horizons. The fieldtrip has well done its objectives. Firstly, I learnt to keep discipline. The fieldtrip regulations were not too strict; we have grown closer and been more sticked together. I was also assumed at discovering my friends and instructors in their different interesting appearances out of class. However, it did not mean that we could ignore the discipline. Obeying laws, following the schedule, and being self-responsible, something like that, are required for a fieldtrip. Besides, I was told many attractive stories about the nature. Over half of 5-kilometer tour around the center was with interminable forests of cajuput, bamboo, eucalyptusâ€¦ That sounds like an adventure, but over all was the feeling in company and mix with the nature. Until then I did not know that fearful subjects as leeches, terrestrial leeches, snakesâ€¦ are signs of pure nature that is no chemical, insecticide; and water hyacinth is sign of non-alum water. There are many kinds of cajuput, and the eucalyptus has another nice name â€œkhuynh diepâ€, more and more I cannot list all. However, I could do ensure that, the air I breathed was perfectly â€œpureâ€. I also learnt the lesson of environment and saving. Muck, water hyacinth can be the important materials for Biogas system, so that necessary fuel is produced for sorts of other activities. The farming system VACBRRR is another great surprise. There are things seem useless can be salvaged effectively. That helps limit harmful consequences to the environment. In other words, according to the instructors that is â€œstable developmentâ€. The center also creates employment for farmers around, trains them for seed rice, pure vegetables. Finally but not least, I gained the lesson about hearts of people there. Their hearts beat for the nature, for the alum agriculture, and for other people. That really makes sense."

The film was set in the Spring-autumn and warring states periods in China, about 2700 years ago. Most of the greatest Masterminds of China were born in this period. The film is highly competitive wits between masterminds. You will get much truth and wisdom after you watching the movie.

Vietnamese,"moral collapse the term ""morality"" now seems to be very strange with many people, especially in young generations; the old generation often complaints so much of this situation. at the present time, many young people didn't know about five constant virtues, including benevolence, righteousness, proprieties,wisdom and fidelity-these characters were seen as moral principles for human being , of course, it was now considered as an old-fashion idea by many people. civics wouldn't be concerned in elementary education; children have been taught about right and duties of a citizen, instead of being well schooled in good manners. that is why, pupils often bully their friends and even hit their teachers when they feel discomfort or dissatisfied about something related to their learning. in society , there are so many cases of murder , homicide... wife killed her husband for committing adultery or money the standards of morality seem to fade away gradually in every one all things will be solved or dealt with contracts and a miss is as good as a mile and eventually the court will be a place for everyone to meet together unhappily at all. and businessmen are willing to pull the wool over customer's eyes to earn a lot of money... all of things are called moral degradation. so what shall we do with the problem? where should we start in order re-establish the moral values in our community? from school or education in family? what have you ever thought of it? and your opinion about it, if you were a person who would be responsible to managing this problem ?"

Vietnamese,"use time efficiently I guess there are many faults,but please correct the passage below. Thank you. Your success partly depends on the way you use time. Everybody has 24 hours a day and 365 days a year,but there are success people and also failed people. It shows that if you spends time in studying and improving your self,your life will be better than the others. One thing you can do to not waste time is finding 2 most important tasks in your daily to-do-list,and during the day,you have to finish them for all you're worth. You should use the 80/20 principle. It says that 80% you have depends on just 20% what you did. So find your 20% important tasks,and do it twice,you will receive many things."

When she was young, she had a round face, a fair complexion and a long black hair. At present, my mother is 51 year old. But she looks much older than the other women at the same age. The reason that my mother often work hard at the field. Therefore, she has no longer a fair complexion and a long black hair. Neverthelrss, her round face is not changeable. Somtimes, I look at my mother' face and find that my mother round' face is very cute. In my eye, my mother is the most beautiful woman in the world. In addition, my mother is specially hard-working. Everyday, she works hard from morning till night in the field and at home. She is really miserable . So, I always promise myself that I must try to study well so that my mother has a better life.

Vietnamese,"It's time. ""It's time"" is the name of a Vietnamese acoustic band just being famous recently. It has 3 members, 2 guitarists and 1 drummer. They are just students and both of them can sing very well. I've known this band through a clip on Youtube. In that clip, the drummer, also the main singer sang with the 12 voices of 12 Vietnamese singers. He was a talented mimicker. This clip also made his band very well known after a short time. Then they became a professional band performing in many shows. They not only covered songs but also composed a few ones to sing. Their songs is really nice. The lyrics is meaningful and belong to the daily life. The melody is mellow in acoustic style. I love to hear them singing live. It makes me feeling so peaceful. They are real young talented artists of Vietnam."

Vietnamese,"Essay : Why do you want to study in United States? How have you prepared or planned to prepare yourself to achieve that goal? Studying in the United States has been my dream since I was a kid. Because the US was a wonderful country in my immature eyes. I have never been to the US. I just see that country on TV. When I was young, I have seen the US many times through the movies and TV programs. And I was amazed at the tall buildings, the light bulbs, and the high technology. I wished to set foot on the Statue of Liberty, White House, Disneyland, and other famous places in the US. I determined to come to the US someday. But the dream of a child did not stop there. When I studied at secondary school, I realized that schools in Vietnam were not ideal study environment. Most schools have old facilities and no modern equipment, some lack laboratory instruments. Education in Vietnam is too heavy on theory, lacking practical and inactive. In each lesson, every knowledge is spoke by the teacher, then students write down. Students must study so hard, with the schedule of five periods a day, and six-day school week. There are up to 12 compulsory subjects at school. Study a lot, but educational efficiency is not high. Vietnamese students are only taught the knowledge in books, and not trained the life skills. Extracurricular activities are also not attached special importance. No sports, no clubs, no entertainment. I need something different, more active, more practical, and more importantly I can learn more than what are in the textbooks. So I want to study abroad in high school. I think high schools in the US would be the good study environment for me. In the US, I could study at a school which has good facilities, apart from classrooms and playground, there are function rooms equipped fully such as computer room, gym, library, lab,... My study will also be better if there are experiments and models in lessons of chemistry, physics and biology. Iâ€™d love to see the experiments and models, because studying science just in theory can not be called â€˜studying scienceâ€™. At school I can speak my own opinions, can make questions to the teacher about what I do not understand. I can joined many outdoor activities such as camping, sports, or elective courses that I enjoy. Acting plays is my favorite, but I have never done it before, because there is not any course like this at my school. The active environment in the US can help me to learn things that I am unable to learn in Vietnam. For instance, I can practice public speaking ability, creative thinking, social skills,..., and learn how to handle unexpected situations. The main curriculum does not take too much time so I can do other things like part-time job or a volunteer work. Moreover, I want to experience an independent life. I have grown, and I need to learn how to live without parents. My father is always thinking that I canâ€™t take care of myself. I want to prove to my parents that I can do everything well without care of them, even in a foreign country. I will cook, do laundry, clean the house by myself. Living in the US also lets me know more about American culture, people and geography. I could welcome Halloween, Christmas, Thanksgiving,..., which are no or not important in Vietnam. I will go to the places where I am yearning to come, so that I realize my childhood dream. To be able to study abroad in the US, the most important is English. I began studying English when I was 7. Although until now my English is still not good, I am trying to improve it. Apart from English, I also studied science subjects well at secondary school. Besides, in order to live alone in a foreign country I need to learn to take care of myself, do housework as well as preparing psychology and the ability to cope alone. Fortunately, I determinded to study abroad for a long time, so I have enough confidence to experience an independent life. I believe that I can do it. About finance, my family has not much money for me to study abroad, but I will try to gain a scholarship. Now my plan is study English, then take a scholarship examination to be able to study in the US next year. This was my essay to attend Vietabroader conference in July ^^!"

Vietnamese,"A nightmare holiday Last summer holiday my family travrled to Haiphong,a north-east coast city of Vietnam. We stayed in a guest house which just some dozens of steps to be able to reach the foot of a 200-metre hill. It was getting darker. Just several minutes later,dark night gradually covered th whole ground. It began raining sporadicly. It was not merely an day-ending rain as usual in summer. That was a storm. It rained harder and harder. Raindrops were much bigger than normal. The wind blew severely so that even long-standing trees were eradicated out of the ground . Blowing wind sounded as the grunt of a herd of wolfs. Flood water current ran from th etop of the hill down to the lower like a stream. It dug up rocks,soils along its way and swept them away. The lightning flared up in the dark sky,the thunder bursted out roarly outside the house. All people were frightend ,some of children were crying. Suddenly,the lights in the house came out. All things surrounding us only were a black curtain. Still it continued raining harder. Leafs fell scatterly in the wind. The strong wind beat repeatedly into the glass windows. A big explosion alongside an electric current passed by the house within few seconds. Luckily, no one was injured . Windows were broken into small pieces and the whole house was shaked slightly. We were really bewildering. The only thing we could do was to sit in silent for fright. I heard clearly heart-beats and hurry breathness. I've never been in such tense situation. I felt that a horrible thing is coming. But,fortunately,the rain was decreasing little by little. The wind was becoming calm. No longer thunder and no longer lightning. The storm was woken. And the lights came back. Everybody shouted happily and cheered . We didn't dare going out of the house. But,it was certain that almost things outside were deystroyed by terrible rage of the flood water flow. It was a horrible nightmare in my real life instead."

Some scientists believe that in the future further advances in medical science may push like expectancy even further. In my opinion, cause of increasing life-span in developed countries thanks to economic development, good knowledge of nutrition and improvements in public health measures, medicine technology. Firstly, the major factor, accounting for increasing life-span, in developed countries economy so the government focus on the quality of peopleâ€™s life. Furthermore, they create more social welfare for citizen in order to make their citizen comfortable psychology and live happier and longer. Secondly, understanding of people about nutrition is better. They know that nutrition plays a major role in keeping their healthy. So they eat in moderation and have adequate meals.

Vietnamese,"comparing and contrasting Ha Noi and Beijing are at once the national capital and the second largest cities of Viet Nam and Beijing . While they are different in many way, they have also have several similarities. This report will compare and contrast the location, size , population and climate feature of the two cities. Firstly, the location feature of the cities differ. Beijing is in nort-eastern China and at the north tip of the North China Plain. Moreover, it is about 60 km north west of the port Tianjin. On the other hand, Ha Noi is the head of the Red River delta and 140 km far from the South Sea China. Secondly, another important difference between the two cities is their size and population. While Ha Noi is only 921 sq km, Beijing is 16,808 sq km in area. Vietnamese, majorly with the biggest minorities of Chinese and Hmong, make up the 4,100,000 population in Ha Noi. However, Beijing has a population of approximately 15,244,000 with 96 percent Chinese Han. Finally, there are similarities and differences in the climates of the two cities. Both have low temperatures in January and high temperatures in July, but Ha Noi is always hotter than Beijing. In addition,Ha Noi is tropical-mosoonal, whereas Beijing is conential-monsoonal. Therefore, Ha Noi 's average annual rainfall is more than Beijing's. Ha Noi has four seasons : the summer is hot, the winter is cold, the spring is warm and the autumn is cool. However, Beijing has two seasons : the summer is hot and humid and the winter is cold and dry. Furthermore, it is clear ,cool and pleasant from mid September to mid October."

Staring at the sky every night, they can foretell whether it is sunny or rainy tomorrow.

Buying a good product in not easy at all. When you have demand for goods,which feature do you attract first?Maybe the quality,the price,or the style. As for me,I have much care about the quality. And if you choose shopping online you needn't bother about it. You only have to type the key word,the name of the product,and there will be a list of that product with all necessary information. The goods come from many different producers and manufacturers all over the world. So you will have many choices. You can compare the one with the others to find out the best. When shopping online,you can buy a product with suitable price. It sounds really great. The price of the product is very various due to the quality and the brand name. Each product has a price tag,which is issued by the producer so you are not afraid of bad bargain. Additionally,the services attach to shopping online are very good. With a computer you can buy whatever you want at home instead of going out. Nowadays,with the greater advance in technology,internet enable people to do many thing at home,these including shopping. Shopping online makes you feel comfortable and save much time. Once you make a decision about the product,the supplier will deliver it to your own house as soon as possible.

Vietnamese,"my frist entry This morning, I got up late at about 8:00 because my lessons started at 9:00 so I could sleep more than another days. When I went out, the sky was grey and a bit foggy. I don't like this weather, it made me feel empty. I went to class quite early, about 20 minutes before the first lesson began. I talked with my friends about our dreams last night and discuss about the dream would become true or not. We had a lot of different ideas, this topic is so exciting. the lessons today were a bit boring, but only good thing was lessons finished earlier 15 minutes than everyday ^^ I looked through the window, it was raining, but not heavy, it was a spring rain. I thought it had been raining for some hours because the road was wet. There were some pools of water on the road go home. Unluckily, while I crossed one of them, a car passed me, the water was splashed all over my clothes. I felt so angry and sad >_< In the afternoon, the weather was coming better. it was cool and a bit sunny. I did not have to go out, just stayed at home and played games. I forgot all things made me angry quickly and felt so happy with my favorite games. I am a little girl, so i like play game which are easy and lovely, such as cooking, fashion games...

Vietnamese,"roast duck. Duck is used to roast which is called roast duck. After selection, they cleaned the duck. After that, all duckâ€™s gut is thrown away. Then they spread on outside and inside of the duck a kind of thick liquid, which contain honey, soy sauce, maltoseâ€¦ to create a water brown yellow. Duckâ€™s belly has been stuffed with many spices. The second step is slightly roasting the stuffed duck on ember until the duckâ€™s color changes from yellow to dark brown, itâ€™s cooked. When eating roast duck, locals never use fish sauce or soy sauce. They have their own special sauce that was prepared for the roast duck. That is the water take from the belly of cooked duck. If roast duck doesnâ€™t have this sauce, itâ€™s not a tasty dish anymore."
Vietnamese,"Confident Confident is a important characteristic to get sucsess. But it's not true that when you need confident, you will have it. What characteristics of a person who have confident? I think one of they is good knowledge. When you know well at something, that means you know how will loss, and the ways to win, so you will have confident. Experience is also necessery. When you praticed and get sucess at a task many times, you will properly have confident to do it one more time. So, how to have confident? I think some people, when they were borned, they had confident. Althought they don't know something well, they don't care about it. They always believe that they can do it, so they do it with comfort, no pressure. It's very good. But almost other are not such people. They only have confident when they had effort, they were hard-working, so they knew it well or they did it many times. There are tasks, however, that you can't try it. You only have a chance to do it. For example, when I took an exam for FPT university, I have not ever do such exam before. In this case, it's more difficult to have confident. There is more way to have confident is "" no comparing with other one"". I thinks comparing sometimes it's good, but sometimes it's also bad. For example, when you and some your friends do the same task. If you compare you to other one, you think you are the best student in this group, I'm sure that you will have confident and finally you finish it early. But oppositly, if you believe you are the bad student in this group, you always think that if everyone can't do it, there would be no reason you can do it. Finally, you will loss. For that reason, I think no compering with other people. In my class, the best students are who have confident. I also want to have confident but I am always hard-working to have it."

However, BA (Hons) Business and Management Studies Programme is always my first choice. Firstly, I really be interested in Business and Management since I was in high school. Secondly, I think it seems to be scientific subject of improving peopleâ€™s thought and virtue, not only training people who are good at earning money and the knowledge of Business and Management helps me control finance, time, especially myself to reach proposed goals. Thirdly, the knowledge of this brings to me unlimited opportunities. I can work for companies or big corporations in Vietnam or other countries after graduating.

Vietnamese,"some customs of Vietnamese^^ hello everybody, today I want to talk about some customs of Vietnam when you come here for first time. if you visit your friend's home, you should know somethings you should do or not. firstly, when you meet my parents (just for examples) or adult, you should fold your arms, make your bow (maybe just a little bow) and say ""xin chÃ o má»i ngÆ°á»i"" like ""hello everybody"" in English. Because it shows respect and it's very polite, or you can shake hand, but do not hug and kiss because Vietnamese isn't used to hugging or kissing for greeting. They will be shy or embarrass, or maybe they feel a little impoliteness. Next, in the dinner, people often use chopsticks for eating, not knives of forks or hands, so you should learn how to use chopsticks for eating. and a note is important to remember is you should say something like ""have a good appetite"" before you eat. because it shows your respect to everyone and make people feel appitite. And now Lunar New Year is upcoming, you should prepare ""lucky money"" to give or ""lixi"" children. that will bring lucky for people and for you in the new year. Inaddition, those are traditional greetings like "" live up to 100 years"" or "" security, good health and prosperity"" or "" may money flow in like water""... In other hand, when you want to give someone a present, especially your lover, remember, donot give a handkerchief, beause handkerchief means ""goodbye"". there are a lot of things to talk about Vietnamese culture, hope you enjoy it! "" HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!"""
Vietnamese,"Sexual attraction I've just watched an interesting TV show and I want to share it with you. It talked about sex attraction. On the other word, it discussed reasons why one man and one woman attracted each other. For example,, have you ever been mesmerised by a flamboyant person? At least, you've impressed by his/her dazzling display of talent. You're not the special case . Women are attracted by power, or you can define it is an attractive man being a noticeable one. Perhaps you think this is stupid and it sounds strange, but in conclusion, instinctively, all we need in sex relationship is desire to have a healthy baby. That's the fact. To do this, we always find a healthy genome which is shown in appearances. In an experiment, scientists designed a computer program that allow men who took part in would change the image of a woman as he wanted. That meant they could adjust size of woman's body as the perfect woman on their mind. The result was quite surprising: It's not big breasts as many might suppose, but it's the ratio between the hips and the waists. The reason was that ratio was a tribute to good fertility. As men, they instinctively knew that, without consciousness. What about women? As I told, they are so impressed by powerful men. In prehistoric times, on the process of revolution, men replaced women to play the major role in family . The most healthy one would become the leader of the clan. His elite social position prove his best gene. That's rather simple reason!"
Vietnamese,"The movie What kind of film do you like? I love action films. Yesterday, I saw a terrific film named â€œTransporter 1â€. It is the first film in a series also consisting of â€œTransporter 2â€ and â€œTransporter 3â€. The film is about a highly skilled driver named Frank known only as ""The Transporter"". He will transport anything without any question. He has three rules which he never breaks: never change the deal, donâ€™t care who the employer is for or what is being transported, never look in the package. He has been hired to transport three bank robbers. Frank is then hired to deliver a package to an American gangster. Complications arises when he breaks one of his rules and finds the package is really a woman. The main character is that really handsome star Jason Statham. He was well-known for his roles in crime films: ""Revolver"",""Snatch"". He looked fantastic with his muscles and perfect body build. His acting is wonderful, too. It was wonderful to see him on the movie, fighting , driving his car on street. You must see how skillful he drives his car to escape the chasing of police. The film concluded with lots of car chasing scenes. The producer maybe used lots of special effects to increase the intensity of these scenes. For example, the scene that the missiles hit Frank 's house was fascinating. The music was not very appropriate,though. I think the music was not good for that kind of movie. But it really wasn't a problem. I hope the next part of series is better. I think whoever loves action films will agree with me that the film is worth watching. If you are a fan of action films, you should see it."
Vietnamese,"Rich countries should help the poors Somebody has said that life had been just. But in reality, there has never exist absolutely justice. There are peoples who are more lucky than others. It is not your obligation to share your benefit, but humanity, sympathy, and conscience make us do this. In bigger level, it should be the way rich countries treat the poors. Mankind is on the way going on a modern, civilized society. It is the whole human kind upright. Everybody shouldn't be selfish. It's time we live in a open world, under effect of globalization, we have relationship with each others, in some ways."

Mandarin,"Voase Special English I have been listening to voase special English,recently. I couldnâ€™t understand the American news toally. But the pronunciation made me feel comfortable. The tone was so perfect. I was so appreciated for the American anchorpersonâ€™s Spoken English. How I wish I could speak English like that someday. I was practicing my Spoken English all this afternoon in the library by myself. I went to the fourth floor because there were few people,and I found an empty room easily. I have typed the words out in the morning. I followed my mobile phone to read the sentence one by one. At first,I found it a little difficult,because I met many new words with meanings I couldnâ€™t understand. There were many personâ€™s names which I couldnâ€™t speak them out correctly,they were so hard to pronunce. Then,it occurred the ideal to give up in my mind. But I get rid of it quickly. So I continued my work until four oâ€™clock. There are no classes tomorrow afternoon,so I will practice my Spoken English continuely. I will never say give up."
Mandarin,Exciting Thanks lucky god. Today I make my first foreign friend here. Sweet day!!
Mandarin,"silence is gold When we talk about the famous proverb ""silence is gold"". We shouldn't lable it right or wrong, but explore it in depth. This proverb is do true under several situations. First, If we have promised to keep a secret, then keep silence and never speak out. Second, If we don't understand on one thing, please don't make any comment on it. The more we talk the more mistake we'll make. Finally when what we are talking may hurt others or invade their privacy we'd better not do that. Nevertheless, there are also some exceptions. If we are very sure what we'll talk are right and don't hurt anyone. Don't hesitate to do it. What's more, if our words can help others. Then don't mean your words. In a word, we can draw the conclusion that ""silence is gold"" is a truth but not always, We should learn to speak the proper words at the proper place in proper time."

Mandarin,"the English Essay Writing Class No one can deny that we can learn many things from the English Essay Writing Class even though someone may do not like it. Some people complain that it is boring and difficult. Furthermore, it wastes us so much time. To some extents they are not wrong, but personally I would like to say: I like the English Essay Writing Class as it is very beneficial and interesting. As we all know, we can gain many benefits from the English Essay Writing Class. First of all, we learn how to organize our sentences logically. As logic is to essay, as oil is to machine. Each essay need a theme to go through and organize what you want to express logically. Second, we can review and consolidate what we have learned before. We have not used words in essay so exact until did we write the assignment by Mr. fan. Although it took us so much time to look up the dictionary to find the exact meaning and usage of each word, it really help us to mater the language. For example, which word should we choose when we want to express one person walks so slowly for pleasure? Saunter? Stroll? Wander? They all mean â€œwalkâ€, but there are a little difference among them. The saunter means to walk in an unhurried way and usually in a confident manner. The stroll means to walk a short distance, slowly and lazily, probably for pleasure. Meanwhile the wander means to walk though an area without aim. Though looking up the dictionary, we can tell the subtle difference among these words and use them better in the essay. The third one is to appreciate the excellent prose, poems and other essays, what is more , we can improve our writing level by imitation. Except that I have mentioned in the previous chapter, I also like the teaching mode and spirit of our teacher. In stead of traditional mode, some other ways are used by Mr. fan such as some lectures online, teaching DVD, introduction of some dictionaries and websites. In stead of having class just in classroom, there is the blog which is set up by Mr. fan himself for us to learn at pastime. For example, we can find many teaching skills, writing skills, beautiful essay as well as information which we want to know. Most of all, I like the teacher, Mr. fan, whose story enough me. I am a student who English is not good from section B. My oral and basic English is poor, let alone my writing. I am so worried about it. But I realized that why Mr. fan can do while I canâ€™t since I heard about the story of Mr. fan. And it is the driving force to push me move on. I do not know how to express my gratitude for Mr. fan. Follow what he sad, do what he told and complete what he ordered is the only thing I can do to repay. And I believe I will be better and better under instruction from him. At last, I hope Mr. Fan can give us some personal advices before corrected our essay for the difference between our English level. If we know where we make mistakes and the reason why we make such mistakes, we can avoid these mistakds next time. Just as the proverb: Fall into a pit, gain into a wit. Right?"

Mandarin,"I want to learn to make Italian food Although I am not a good cook, I like to read cooking books and cook different and new dishes. I like to cook for families and watch them eat with joyness. Therefore, whenever I succeeded in making a new dish, I always cant wait to let my family taste it. On the other hand, sometimes I failed to make a new dish, I felt sad and tired for all the efforts I put in making it. Anyway, last week, I went to a bookstore and found a very good Italian cooking book. I bought the book right away and wheneverI had time I read it. The more I read, the more I feel that making Italian food is kind of hard, I am planning to make one dish from the book this weekend, bï½•t the problem is getting the ingredient. I dont know where I can get all the ingredients I need to make that dish. I will gï½ to malls and check if they have what I want. Maybe eating out is cheaper than making Italian food at home afterall ><"

Mandarin,"Clothing,Colors,andCultures The meanings of colors are sometimes very different in different cultures. For example,in some cultures,blue is a common clothing color for little boys,and pink is a common clothing color for little girls. In other cultures,other colors are common for boys and girls. There are also different colors for special days in different cultures. For example, white is the traditional color of a wedding dress in some cultures, but other colors are traditional in other cultures. For some people, white is a happy color. For others, it's a sad color. For some pelple, red is a beautiful and lucky color. For others, it's a very sad color. What are the meanings of different colors in YOUR culture?"
Mandarin,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A job with more vacation time is better than a job with high salary but less vacation time. The issue whether people should choose a job with a high salary or more vacation time is a topic that is often discussed and there are differing opinions about this issue. Some prefer to have a high salary, because they could buy some things that they like most, while others would choose a job with more vacation time for enjoying themselves. In my view, I prefer to have a job with more vacation time instead of a high salary for several reasons. Admittedly, earning money is one of the aims of our work. No one could deny the fact that money could not only maintain our daily lives but also could help us to achieve some of our personal goals, such as buying a car, living in a big house or helping those who live in poverty or starvation. Making money will enable us to improve our living environment and quality, and therefore getting a job with a high salary, is significant to us. However, others go into rapture at mere notion of getting money, however having a job with a high salary, is less useful than many people believe. People, who are addicted to a high income, have to spend more time working or staying in the office, and as a result, it is impossible for them to devote enough time and energy in communicating with family members. Moreover, it is difficult to develop and cultivate their childrenâ€™s character and interpersonal skills and they may become more solitary and even suffer from certain emotional or psychological problems. Therefore, it is undesirable to hanker for a high salary instead of staying with family members. Furthermore, the majority of people believe that having more vacation time will provide them additional opportunities to broaden their horizons, which may put them in a favorable position prove their situation. As we know, traveling can allow us to actually meet different cultures, which we could not get from textbooks or classrooms. As an architect, although he could learn about masterpieces from the internet and magazines, the feeling of touch of the actual buildings, such as the Sydney Opera house, is totally differentï¼Œ We could find abundant information about the plans, sections and elevations, but we could not recognize the size, the space or the material. Having vacation time and traveling could provide us with an opportunity to realize the dream and therefore almost all of us benefit from vacation time. Therefore, I am firmly convinced that having a job with more vacation time, will bring about a profound impact on families, the person himself and even the society as whole."

Mandarin,"Bad Day of Ambulation Street Now I also do remmeber what happened on the day clearly. Because my cellphone was stolen on that evening. On the afternoon, my friends and me went to the ambulation street and found a restaurant for eating. There were so many peoples that a big table was surrounded by us. All of us were so happy and we all forgot which time it was,and we didn't finish our dinner before 21:00. After eating,we said goodbye to each other. On my way school,a friend of me were talking about everything which was interseting. Maybe I was so cheerful that I didn't care anything,including wallet,cellphone and other precious things. Suddenly,the friend asked me to buy a piece of waterpelon for her,I promised her immediately and then I was about to open my backbag and took some money. To be surprised,I found my bag was opened by others! Fortunately,my wallet hadn't gone. After a while,I want to know the time,so I was just like what usual I do,to see the clock of cellphone. It's unbelivable that my cellphone was missing and I look for it carefully but I was failure to find it. Immediately,I went back to the restaurant with light speed. I believed that my cellphone was left in the restaurant by me not stolen by thief,but after a period of asking,I admited the fact that my cellphone was stolen. After arrivaled dormitory I thought that If I hadn't gone to the ambulation street my cellphone would not lost. Because of the accident,I have made a decision that I won't go out for playing,unless I have specia thing have to do. At the same time,I think those thieves' behaviour is immoral."
Mandarin,"Chinese Good Men There are four classmates, including me, living in the dormitory. One of us is a pure and crazy businessman, he always cuts his classes days without any reasonable excuses. I think it's full of ideas of how to earn money from the large amount of students and start his enterprise in his mind. The second one is me, who is not a good student either. Once I was given make-up exams twice by the teachers, what's worst, I also cut my school days many times. I am the one who is relatively focus on the efficient way of dealing with things. There are so many old regulation rules in our life, which are really inefficient and boring. As the society development, we young men need some dynamic ways to enrich ourselves. Let us get to the point, the education we are having is mostly for getting a college diploma. I don't know if it's a truth, but the performance of many university students and someone's saying do show me that reality. I don't care much about what's it but to seek what is valuable for me. Now, to be honest, now my mind is full with all kinds of ideas of how to develop myself and go a further and successful way in life. Yeah, both two guys mentioned above are not common students. What're the common and good students? According to the traditional and social views, they are used to doing what people had done and try their best to have a good job for them. Anyway, how should I define the ""good student""? In my opinion, we should do well in the traditional study efficiently as soon as possible, and then we can do something what interest us. The style of teaching nowadays should be reformed, at least it's necessary and better for our university. I don't know what the situations are in other university in China. Anyway, the rest of two roommates, so-called the ""Chinese good men"" I said , are very good for girls. Yeah, one has a girlfriend, and the other hasn't. Both of them are very care for their girls. They are good at cooking, making delicious soup in particular. Do you know, what's the pop boyfriend in our life? I would like to tell you that they are handsome, excellent, rich and so on. We know those are the main factor of some girls' choice of boyfriend. So, there are few of guy can be so good in this materialistic times. Maybe the word of ""good"" is not good enough to describe them, due to my poor vocabulary. They are so precious that I am very proud of them, and I should learn from them in some ways,lol!! The last but not least, I should mention that the first guy and I are just not care enough for girls. If I may say so, I think we are going to follow the pop style of boyfriend, if we aren't aware of that issues. Today, there was tempting smell of soup full of our room. Wow, I was dying when I smelt it, what a delicious soup it was! But unfortunately, the soup is only for his girl. Oh, what a pity!! Haha......."
Mandarin,"A Debacle I got my TEM-4(Test for English Major-Band 4)grades yesterday, and it really shocked me. It was the first time that I got such a low mark in five years, and it just terrified me!However, after a profound consideration and introspection, I got reasons. First and foremost, defective psychological diathesis is the key that brings about my failure. I'm too nervous to answer the question. Secondly, I do not strive for this test wholeheartedly by virtue of the preparation of Japanese Language Proficiency Test Level 3 as well as GRE. In spite of the fact that it hurts me a little bit, I will never, ever be frustrated by it and be suspicious of my ability! Convinced that success: being successful on the efforts of paying is not necessarily return, pay no return, I choose to pay."

For example,extreme sports is very excited but also it's dangerous to many people. As a college student,I'm in favor of appropriate recreational activities. Because it's benefit for our health and it may let us be more efficient and cheerful."

Mandarin,"dream Every one has an unextraodinary or great dream in his (her) heart to achieve something. None of us has the right to take oneâ€™s dream away. However, I payed a bad role of breaking my studentâ€™s dream last sunday. Since I had went into university I have been doing part-time work as a tutor at weekends. My student employeed me early days in september to instructe her to learn instead the supplyment classes. As all of the students who have tutors in their families, she was in the hope that a tutor will be enable her to succeed in the national universities admission examination,which will be held on 7th,june,next year. I had been to her home 6 times in total before last Sunday. I have to admitted that she had been doing a hard work those two months. While, because two years had sliped from her hands,she had been left far away behind her classmates in accademy. There was no any progress she had made after two monthes hardship and ,at the same time she was getting impatient for only 7 monthes left for preparing the test. Though,she was still stick to her dream that she will succeed. To be honest,the time is too short for her to pass it. There will be some possibilities for her to succeed on 7th, june, 2012. ting on a sudden impulse, told her what I had thought in my heart and advised her to prepare the examination in 2012. I didnâ€™t see her face lit up any longer. Consequently, I was fired. I was too selfish to take her feeling when her dream was broken into account and hurt her heart. It is a good lesson and I would remember it immortally. It will serve as a impressive remind of I should be more skillful when I express my opinion to others. Above all, I have no access to break anyone elseâ€™s dream, whatever the situation is."

Mandarin,"Abstract of my paper The trend of the study of Daoism in ancient Japan recently can be divided into two aspects. One is continuing to indicate what elements of Daoism have been absorbed by ancient Japan. It consciously tried to provide more arguments on how these elements entered and have affected Japan than related studies of last period. The other is to explain why Japanese envoys to Tang turned down the request of sending Daoist to Japan made by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang in 753. These two sides seem self-contradiction as they show that Daoism was rejected by Japan officially and meanwhile, many elements of Daoism existed in ancient Japan. Shimode Sekiyo once figured out the kind of Daoism practiced in ancient Japan is Folk Daoism (Shimode, 1974:226). But in fact, it could not interpret the elements of Daoism also founded at the official level. In this paper, I want to make the overall picture of Daoism in ancient Japan more clearly. I focus on the understanding of Daoism by Japanese RitsuryÅ state å¾‹ä»¤å›½å®¶ and the founder of the Shingon çœŸè¨€, KÅ«kaiç©ºæµ·(774-835), as the two subjects both have shown their understandings of Daoism as a whole religion. Japanese RitsuryÅ state regarded Daoism as the religion representing Tang Dynasty and thought the content of Daoism was the methods of Daoist masteré“å£«æ³•. The result is that it tried to keep Daoist master from Japan and proscribed the methods of Daoist master in non-governmental circles. KÅ«kai considered Daoism as techniques toward immortality in his book SangÅ shiiki ä¸‰æ•™æŒ‡å¸° and chose Buddhism as his belief finally. The common point of the two understandings of Daoism is there isnâ€™t core divinity concept of Dao but only methods, techniques of Daoism. Based on this, Daoism without Dao never really existed in Japan as its own separate, organized religion while it has an unmistakable influence on Japanese religion culture via its methods of various techniques, rites, symbols, charms and so on."

Mandarin,"Internet, Not the Best Source of Information All the Time In the age of information explosion, science is developing and knowledge is renewing itself rapidly. There is no doubt that computers and the Internet have become an integral part of our daily lives. Hence, many people have grown dependent on the Internet and argue that it is the best source of information. From my perspective, the Internet is indeed very useful and convenient in many cases, but it is not always the best choice when we need to search something, especially something important. The Internet is an awesome tool when we look for some certain information, since it is convenient, cheap and easy to use. For instance, having been typed some simple words, Google Maps can give us a wise advice of how to get to a newly opened restaurant or an art exhibition in seconds, while Wikipedia is always there waiting for us to discover any amazing knowledge we do not know. Even our grandparents can do these without any troubles. And it is more exciting considering that most of the services on the Internet are free! All we need is a computer and a modem. Nevertheless, sometimes the Internet is not as perfect as we expect it to be. Information on the Internet may be fake or not so accurate because everyone can upload anything without censorship. So if you need any accurate statistics or serious and formal references, some traditional information sources like books and academic journals can be the better choices. In addition, just as we are in the era of â€œinformation explosionâ€, some ancient but useful information may be hidden by numerous new ones on the Internet. In this case we should put away our computers and turn to the libraries. Consequently, the Internet can be the â€œbestâ€ source in most situations because it is not expensive, it is easy to get used to and provide a large amount of information. But this is not always true, especially when we are in need of some specialized materials. We should treat the new favorite of our age rationally and use it in a correct way."

However, one of my classmates told me that we were the few people who didn't find a innership for ourselves in this summer holiday. I felt a little worried as if i had been left behind a lot. But i know that there is no need to do that in a hurry. You can have a job in the future.

Mandarin,"Chinese education systemï¼ˆ1ï¼‰--the early education Mister Want was curious about Chinese school system, she said she would like anything that I can tell her. As a result, I try to make a simple introduction of education system of China. All the things I said would only apply for mainland China. Every child aged seven would be sent to primary (or elementary) school, but most children start their education much younger than seven years old. They are usually sent to nursery schools because their parents don't have much time to keep an eye on their children or those parents want their children be inspired the early the better. I was sent to nursery school at eight months old since my parents were busy with their work. Nowadays, more parents consider more of the teaching quality of nursery schools, some of them may even spend quite a little money in order to send their children to an entire English-environmental nursery school. They hope their children would be able to speak native English in fluency by this wayï¼Œ though I don't think that works. At nursery school, children will be taught things like simple maths--add and subtract, painting, easy Chinese characters, dialogues in polite, some handwork. Before primary school, you can also enter kindergaten which help children to prepare for this step. Kindergatens will teach something more difficult than nursery schools'. In the next six years, you have to play a role as a pupil. You must learn how to be polite and studious. You must greet whichever teacher whenever you see them. You have to greet to the teacher who are going to have a class for you before start. We will gather on the playground on Mondays to hold a ceremony. We would salute during the flag raising ceremony and sing our national song after it. Then we would standï¼ˆif you are lucky enough, you are allowed to sit on the little chair that is brought by you) and listen to the principal(or schoolmaster) or other school leaders who is giving a speech. The substance of most speeches is about ethicsï¼Œ virtues or important news. We recieve partriotic education mostly during this period. We learn subjects named Chinese, Maths, PEï¼Œ Nature and society, Labor, Art, Musicï¼Œ English. English won't be learned as soon as you enter the school. You may only start learning ABC in grade three or four. ï¼ˆIt is said that English is taught since grade one now.ï¼‰ In my opinion, our education basically lacks of explorations or interactions. Pupils are encouraged to memorize as much knowledage ï¼ˆyou define those knowledge as facts) as they can instead of thinking of how to solute a problem creatively. That's why most Chinese students can often get a good mark but seldom make big achievements. We do have excellent fondational education but lack of inspirations. In the last year of primary school, a test would be given but it doesn't really matter your later education as far as you have passed. You will be at least sent to a middle school near your house which is elected by a computer randomly. Of course, if you want to control your life by yourself instead of a computer, you can spend some money to have tests of some good schools, let them decide if you are clever enough to have a seat."

Mandarin,"Happy mid-autumn festival Today is the mid-autumn festival in China. It's a lunar calendar festival. Every year, August 15th in lunar calendar, we meet perfect full moon and cool autumn air. If the day doesn't rain, and the sky doesn't cloud, we'll go out at night and admire the beautiful moon. Of course, it would be extremely lonely if you watch the moon alone, so we always gather together with our family or friends, and eat traditional dessert, which always too sweet for me, the mooncake.

Mandarin,"I feel bored Now,I am enjoying my summer holiday. This holiday lasts 3 months. I never have such a long holiday before. In the past,I spent my holiday in doing my homework or taking summer courses. But now,I have temporarily escaped from heavy study burden. However,I cannot make good use of this long holiday. I just sit at the desk and surf the Internet everyday. I feel time dull and boring. I don't know what else I can do to make my holiday colorful. What do you usually do during holidays? Can you give me some good advice not to waste this golden holiday?"

Mandarin,"After Watching 2012 2012 is a movie and a phenomenon. It really tells us only the earth is humans' home, and we should protect her and develop sustainably. But It also showed the world is coming to end by 2012. This theory is repeated again and again. Some people even declaim that they've found the lost money caused by financial crisis is used to build arks in Himalayas. They also prove the theory by telling Lech Kaczynski is not dead but leading to the arks. The frequently happened earthquakes also increased the terror among the public. Lies after repeated thousand of times become truth, but the 2012 theory is repeated by millions of people time and time again. I just heard one of our patients said ""The world is going to end by 2012, that means we have at most two years to live, and why should we still work so hard? Why not give up the job, leave the desease alone and have a good time?"" I thought if we didn't stop him from leaving hospital, he would have been suiciding by never injecting insulin. I want to forbid the movie from showing, because the 2012 is no longer a movie, but a propoganda to broadcast the anti-human theory. Lots of people earn money by telling others expensive ways to survive the fanciful disaster, driving others to believe, to fear, and to give up what belong to themselves. After all I watched the movie because my fucking speaking english teacher want us to believe and even make it the exam but I hope you don't watch it. Some devil is hiding behind the screen counting the cash and laughing that there is another big fish."
Mandarin,"How to teach kids? I have a new student today. He is 4 years old and very shy. He really doesn't like to stay with unfamiliar person. In some times, this is a good character and which can make sure for safety. But for me it is a big problem. It makes my job more hard. The boy insistently held his grandmother's clothes and sadly cry when I close to him. It seems how rude I am! I have total 11 students in that class. It is unreasonable to spend all time on only one student, and also I can't give up him. Q: Do you have some advice for teaching the shyness kids?"

Mandarin,"Making Cites Greener Making Cites Greener Maybe it is not a question in the past, but nobody dare to say it now. More and more people recognize that it is very important for us to make our cities greener. With the development of the economy, the area of the city becomes larger than before. In order to get more wood, more and more trees were cut down in the past. It is not easy to find the woods around the cities. More and more buildings, which made by the concrete, founded around us. It has been the symbol of the modern society. More and more cities take part in the competition who have the highest building. But now, the things changed, more and more coutries find the import of making cities greener. In fact, we can get more benefit from the making cities greener. At first, with the develop of the economy, more and more private cars used in our cities, and they also bring us more exhaust gas and pollute our environment, but the green plants can absorb and decompose the pollution. The second, the green is good for us to reduce the pressure. And the green makes our cities more beautiful."

Mandarin,"How do you see teamwork or personal capacity. (oral English) How do you see teamwork or personal capacity. We can not live without our colleagues and friends. Can say that we do live in the team all the time. we can training our the ability to communicate with others, cooperative skills, and leadership ability and to be led. we also need to exercise our own personal capacity.

Mandarin,"April Fool's Day Today was April the first, you all know what a special day it is. Actually, I had been ready to take all the tricks from my friends or classmate. However, none of them made fun of any other. I didn't know why; maybe they were so anxious about the TEM4 that they forgot anything else even if it was something very funny. Since nobody was in mood in doing any mischief, I also put it aside and focused on my own business. After my professional class, I attended the class named the Theory of Education. The couse itself is dull while the teacher is more boring. Today there were few people turned up in his class, which annoyed him a lot, so he called attendance. You know students are afraid of this kind of stuff because it relates to their final grade. Fair enough, since they did not come, the teacher wanted to revenge by cut down their points, which can give them a warn. Well, I didn't like the techer neither especially today. He was talking something that I hate or I have no interest in. So I just kept reading my own novel or chatting with my online friend. Finally the class was over. As you know every Friday, I have to teach as a voluntary teacher. This after-noon. I went to the school again with my team members. The moment we got there, we were surrounded by the children as if they haven't seen us for a long time and missed us a lot . I don't know whether they are, but I want to tell you tha t I was happy today. I taught them music. Most of them were quiet and concentrative on what I said in the class. Since we decided to take record of their behavior in the class as an evidence to show their hardworking. They were soft and resonble than before, which made the class easier to move on. I got a cold and had sore throat so it was a bit difficult for me to speak loud in the class. Fortunately, they were not noisy so that everything went on well. After two classes, our task was finished so we went backe to our campus. After I got changed my dress, I went to jog as usual. I felt very tired but I still finished ten laps. I do think it really require our persistence and patience. Tomorrow is Saturday, but we still have make-up class. Because we are going to have the so called QingMing festival, on which day family members get together and go to their ancestors' tombs to commemorate them ans show their love and miss for them. Since we are far away from home, what we are going to do is stay at where we are or go out have fun with our friends. Well, I stil have some homework to do. Let's call it a day."
Mandarin,"The necessary to read children a story by youself I took part in an English exam a few months ago,and I had to write an essay , whose theme was whether it was necessary to read children a story by yourself. It is evident that parents should read their children the story even though children themselves could read such stuff through Internet by themselves. one reason is that it could foster family love. On the other hand, there are lots of harmful information to children, such as pornorgraphy , violence etc. Children are very susceptible these content. In an hour, I can only write something mentioned above . Could some friends help me correct this essay in pros and cons explicitly."
Mandarin,"Make a introduction I am very surprise for the failure with the send of the introduction. I writed a introduction about myself several days ago. I find it in my draft today. so I introduce myself again. I am very happy for entering the website and have the chance to meet so many foreigner friends. I dream I can speak english well. But my english is so limited. I use english usually in my work, but my english is poor all the time. Is my method wrong? maybe! I hope all the friends can study language well that you want to learn. Despite the language is hard. but I believe that work hard can do it. I hope my dream will be true."
Mandarin,"Chapter 9 How to Avoid Arguments One of the most difficult challenges in our loving relationships is handling differences and disagreements. Often when couples disagree their discussions can turn into arguments and then without much warning into battles. Suddenly they stop talking in a loving manner and automatically begin hurting each other : blaming, complaining, accusing, demanding, resenting, and doubting. Men and women arguing in this way hurt not only their feelings but also their relationship. Just as communication is the most important element in a relationship, arguments can be the most destructive element, because the closer we are to someone, the easier it is to bruise or be bruised. --------------------------------------------------------------- Just as communication is the most important element in a relationship, arguments can be the most destructive element. ------------------------------------------------------------------ For all pratical purposes I strongly recommend that couples not argue. When two people are not sexually involved it is a lot easier to remain detached and objective while arguing or debating. But when couples argue who are emotionally involved and especially sexually involved, they easily take things too personally. As a basic guideline: never argue. Instead discuss the pros and cons of something. Negotiate for what you want but don't argue. It is possible to be honest, open, and even express negative feelings without arguing or fighting. Some couples fight all the time, and gradually their love dies. On the other extreme, some couples suppress their honest feelings in order to avoid conflict and not argue. As a result of suppressing their true feelings they lose touch with their loving feelings as well. One couple is having a war while the other is having a cold war. It is best for a couple to find a balance between these two extremes. By remembering we are from different planets and thus developing good communication skills, it is possible to avoid arguments without suppressing negative feelings and conflicting ideas and desires. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ARGUE Without understanding how men and women are different it is very easy to get into arguments that hurt not only our partner but also ourselves. The secret to avoiding arguments is loving and respectful communication. The differences and disagreements don't hurt as much as the ways in which we communicate them. Ideally an argument does not have to be hurtful; instead it can simply be an engaging conversation that expresses our differences and disagreements.(Inevitably all couples will have differences and disagree at times.) But pratically speaking most couples start out arguing about one thing and, within five minutes, are arguing about the way they are arguing. Unknowingly they begin hurting each other; what could have been an innocent argument, easily resolved with mutual understanding and an acceptance of differences, escalates into a battel. They refuse to accept or understand the content of their partner's point of view because of the way they are being approached. Resolving an argument requires extending or stretching our point-of view to include and integrate another point of view. To make this strtch we need to feel appreciated and respected. If our partner's artitude is unloving, our self- esteem can actually be wounded by taking on their point of view. ------------------------------------------------ Most couples start out arguing about one thing and ,within five minutes, are arguing about the way they are arguing. --------------------------------------------------------------------- The more intimate we are with someone, the more difficult it is objectively to hear their point of view without reacting to their negative feelings. To protect ourselves from feeling worthy of their disrespect or disapproval automatic defenses come up to resist their point of view. Even if we agree with their point of view, we may stubbornly persist in arguing with them. WHY ARGUMENTS HURT It is not what we say that hurts but how we say it. Quite commonly when a man feels challenged, his attention becomes focused on being right and he forgets to be loving as well. Automatically his ability to communicate in a caring, respectful, and reassuring tone decreates. He is aware neither of how uncaring he sounds nor of how hurtful this is to his partner. At such times, a simple disagreement may sound like an attack to a woman; a request turns into an order. Naturally a woman feels resistant to this unloving approach, even when she would be otherwise receptive to the content of what he was saying. A man unknowingly hurts his partner by speaking in an uncaring manner and then goes on to explain why she should not be upset. He mistakenly assumes she is resisting the content of his point of view, when really his unloving delivery is what upsets her. Because he does not understand her reaction, he focuses more on explaining the merit of what he is saying instead of correcting the way he is saying it. He has no idea that he is starting an argument; he thinks she is arguing with him. He defends his point of view while she defends herself from his sharpened expressions, which are hurtful to her. When a man neglects to honor a woman's hurt feelings he invalidates them and increases her hurt. It is hard for him to understand her hurt because he is not as vulnerable to uncaring comments and tones. Consequently, a man may not even realize how much he is hurting his partner and thus provoking her resistance. Similarly, women don't realize how they are hurtful to men. Unlike a man, when a woman feels challenged the tone of her speech automatically becomes increasingly mistrusting and rejecting. This kind of rejection is more hurtful to a man, especially when he is emotionally involved. Women start and escalate arguments by first sharing negative feelings about their partner's behavior and by giving unsolicited advice. When a woman neglects to buffer her negative feelings with messgaes of trust and acceptance, a man responds negatively, leaving the woman confused. Again she is unaware of how hurtful her mistrust is to him. To avoid arguing we need to remember that our partner objects not to what we are saying but to how we are saying it. It takes two to argue, but it only takes one to stop an argument. The best way to stop an argument is to nip it in the bud. Take responsibility for recognizing when a disagreement is turning into an argument. Stop talking and take a time-out. Reflet on how you are approaching your partner. Try to understand how you are not giving them what they need. Then, after some time has passed, come back and talk again but in a loving and respectful way. Time-outs allow us to cool off, heal our wounds, and center ourselves before trying to communicate again. THE FOUR F'S FOR AVOIDING HURT There are basically four stances that individuals take to avoid getting hurt in arguments. They are the four f's: fight, flight, fake, and fold. Each of these stances offers a short-term gain,but in the long run they are all counterproductive. Let's explore each of these positions. 1. Fight. This stance definitely comes from Mars. When a conversation becomes unloving and unsupportive some individuals instinctively begin to fight. They immediately move into an offensive stance. Their motto is "" the best defense is a strong offense."" They strike out by blaming, judging, criticizing, and making their partner look wrong. They tend to start yelling and express lots of anger. Their inner motive is to intimidate their partner into loving and supporting them. When their partner backs down, they assume they have won, but in truth they have lost. --------------------------------------------------- Intimidation always weakens trust in a relationship. --------------------------------------------------- Intimidation always weakens trust in a relationship. To muscle your way into getting what you want by making others look wrong is a sure way to fail in a relationship. When couples fight they gradually lose their ability to be open and vulnerable. Women close up to protect themselves and men shut down and stop caring as much. Gradually they lose whatever intimacy they had in the beginning. 2. Fight. This stance also come from Mars. To avoid confrontation Martians may retire into their caves and never come out. This passive-aggressive behavior is not the same as taking a time-out and then coming back to talk and resolve things in a more loving fashion. These Martians are afraid of confrontation and would rather lie low and avoid talking about any topics that may cause an argument. They walk on eggshells, but men do also. It is so ingrained in men that they don't even realize how much they do it. Rather than arguing, some couples will simply stop talking about their disagreements. Their way of trying to get what they want is to punish their partner by withholding love. They do not come out and diretly hurt their partners, like the fighters. Instead they indirectly hurt them by slowly depriving them of the love they deserve. By withholding love our partners are sure to have less to give us. The shor-term gain is peace and harmony, but if issues are not being talked about and feelings are not being heard then resentments will build. In the long run, they lose touch with the passionate and loving feelings that drew them together. They generally use overworking, overeating, or other addictions as a way to numb their unresolved painful feelings. 3. Fake. This stance comes from Venus. To avoid being hurt in a confrontaion this person pretends that there is no problem. She puts a smile on her face and appears to be very agreeable and happy with everything. Over time, however, these women become increasingly resentful; they are always giving to their partner but they do not get what they need in return. This resentment blocks the natural expression of love. They are afraid to be honest about their feelings, so they try to make everything ""all right, OK, and fine."" Men commonly use these phrases, but for them they mean something completely different. He means ""it is OK because I am dealing with it alone"" or ""It's all right because I know what to do"" or ""It's fine because I am handling it, and I don't need any help."" Unlike a man, when a woman uses these phrases it may be a sign that she is trying to avoid a conflict or argument. To avoid making waves, a woman may even fool herself and believe that everything is OK,fine, and all right when it really isn't. She sacrifices or denies her wants, feelings, and needs to avoid the possibility of conflict. 4. Fold. This stance also comes from Venus. Rather than argue this person gives in. They will take the blame and assume responsibility for whatever is upsetting their partner. In the short run they create what looks like a very loving and supportive relationship, but they end up losing themselves. A man once complained to me about his wife. He said, ""I love her so much. She gives me everything I want. My only complaint is she is not happy."" His wife had spent twenty years denying herself for her husband. They never fought, and if you asked her about her relationship she would say ""We have a great relationship. My husband is is loving. Our only problem is me. I am depressed and I don't know why."" She is depressed because she has denied herself by being agreeable for twenty years. To please their partners these people intuitively sense their partners's desires and then mold themselves in order to please. Eventually they resent having to give up themselves for love. Any form of rejection is very painful because they are already rejecting themselves so much. They seek to avoid rejection at all costs and want to be loved by all. In this process they literally give up who they are. You may have found yourself in one of these four f's or in many of them. People commonly more from one to the other. In each of the above four strategies our intention is to protect ourselves from being hurt. Unfortunately, it does not work. What works is to identify arguments and stop. Take a time-out to cool off and then come back and talk again. Practice communicating with increased understanding and respect for the opposite sex and you will gradually learn to avoid arguments and fights."

They try to get a summary of the cadidate. Then they will make a decision of the second interview. The candidatie, usually, is asked to speak English by those foreign-invested companies. I felt so bad because of my poor listening English. I prefer interview by face to face rather than by telephone."

Mandarin,"Are students nowadays less knowledgeable than before? As the internet is popular all over the world, more and more students nowadays spend more time surfing on the internet, and they prefer watching movies on DVDâ€™s to reading the books. That is why quite a few teachers complain about students reading fewer books than before. But in my opinion, itâ€™s not means that students today are less knowledgeable than before. First of all, the development of information technologies changes the pattern of reading. Today more and more press choose to publish e-journals and e-books, therefore students can get them easily on the internet and read on computers or cell phones. If teachers see their students sitting in front of computers, they should not worry whether the students are playing, maybe the students are reading e-books. Secondly, the internet has changed the world and leads explosion of knowledge, and people have to know more information than before that they canâ€™t live without internet. Students can get the immediate information from the internet, while the information of the books is somehow out of date. The third concern is that itâ€™s very convenient to get knowledge on the internet. Students can read e-book while in school or at home. Thatâ€™s the reason why students donâ€™t want take the heavy books home. In a word, I prefer that students today are more knowledgeable even though they read fewer books than before."

Mandarin,"Single's Day Today is 11th November, it's Single's Day. The Single's Day is named by some students in campus initially.

In Chinese, we call bachelor as ""bare stick"", so when they found four ""bare stick"" in a row on calendar, they understood that today was belongs to single. This is the origin of Single's Day. Now, almost everyone knows that 11th November is a special Day. The media and business sector are all taking this matter to speculation. Moreover, according to its original meaning, the Single's Day is just belongs to single male, but the girls are unwilling to be alone.

Mandarin,"How to tell a Chinese Teacher from Foreign One A teacher sits on the desk while students sit causally in the classroom, then the teacher tells a joke making the whole class laugh loudly. Can you tell where the teacher comes from, China or other foreign countries? I think the answer is oblivious. That must be a foreign teacher. If you are curious about how I draw that conclusion, let's see the differences between the Chinese and foreign teachers. The most significant difference is the targets of teaching. Usually,Chinese teachers aim at helping students learn English more efficiently and do a good job in finals,while foreign teachers' goals are encouraging students to speak English as much as possible and arousing students' interests in English. If the targets differ, what they teach definitely differs. The Chinese teachers teach students a lot of grammars, words, useful skills from the textbook and every minute in class is precious, while foreign teachers will give the students more time to speak in class and the topics are closely related to students' lives. The second difference is the qualities of Chinese and foreign teachers. Chinese teachers are more familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of Chinese students,so teachers can tell them the common mistakes made by students and how to avoid in exams,while foreign teachers know little about those. But foreign teachers have a good knowledge of English culture and native sayings. Besides,the accent of a foreign teacher is much more standard,which can improve students' ability to listen and speak better. In addition,the languages used by teachers differ from Foreign and Chinese teachers. Foreign teachers can only use English in teaching whereas Chinese teachers can combine English and Chinese together. Making English the only language in class can force student to pay more attention to listening. In contrast, combing two languages in teaching can make teachers fully understood but students may overly dependent on Chinese to express themselves. The last difference is the result of the former aspects. The atmosphere in class differs from English and Chinese teachers. Students often feel relaxed and happy in a foreign teacher's class while in a Chinese teacher's class the situation seems more serious and students is always busying with taking notes from the blackboard. To conclude, the four differences in Chinese and foreign teachers can help you understand your teachers' teaching methods. Chinese teachers and foreign teachers both have pros and cons. Your own efforts on language studying are much more important than which country your teachers come from."

Mandarin,"Diogenes and Five-willow Gentleman A couple of days ago I reread Tao Yuanmingâ€™s Story of Five-willow Gentlemanï¼ˆã€Šäº”æŸ³å…ˆç”Ÿä¼ ã€‹é™¶æ¸Šæ˜Ž AD 365â€” AD 427ï¼‰, which is contained in one of my junior high school Chinese textbooks. Five-willow Gentleman is one of the best- known imaginary figures in China, who is believed to be the incarnation of the poet himself. Ancient Chinese literati liked to air their opinions, values of life, dissatisfaction or grievances, not by saying them straight out, but rather through his description of somebody else and through his eulogy of that person. This Five-willow Gentleman lived in a shabby hovel, wore tattered clothes, and ate insipid food. He was once a government official, but after seeing the dark and corruptive working style of the government, he decided to quit and return to the countryside. He liked wine but was too poor to gain its access. When his old acquaintances invited him to drink, he drank to his heartâ€™s content and got very drunk, then departed right away with scant thanks to the hosts. In the end of the verse, he was lauded as â€œNeither grumble about poverty, nor carve for honour and riches (ä¸æˆšæˆšäºŽè´«è´±ï¼Œä¸æ±²æ±²äºŽå¯Œè´µ)â€. Yesterday when I was reading the story of Diogenes (412 or 404 BC -323 BC), he struck me as the Greek version of Five-willow Gentleman. They were both satisfied with the poorest living condition; only that Diogenes seemed to have got even closer to the extreme. He lived in a half-broken urn, wore rags hardly covering his body, sauntered in the market place, begging for food. They both acted in defiance of the mainstream of social values. Diogenes despised the masses who did not share his religion, and by no means he could endure them: he repaid their jeers with jibes and their pebbles with a shower of stones. He even took no account of Alexander the Great, when the latter condescended to visit him. While everybody else was flattering and cheering for Alexander, he simply asked him to move away for he was â€œblocking the sunlightâ€. He was so cool that Alexander said admiringly, â€œIf I were not Alexander, I should be Diogenes.â€ At a casual glance, Diogenes and Five-willow Gentleman were really much alike. They both felt contented with their extreme poverty and their carefree lifestyle. They both cared little about sensual pleasure while focusing more on spiritual happiness. They both disdained popular social modes and values. They were both too obstinate to change themselves to fit in the society. It seemed to me that despite the intervening hundreds of years between their living times and the thousands of miles between their locations, they were actually sharing the same principle of living. However, after a closer look at their stories, I began to discern the differences between them. Underneath similar appearances lay their respective cores of qualities and values. Diogenes is one of the founders of Cynicism while Five- willow Gentleman is considered a good follower of Taoism. Having taken a cursory look, I found these two schools of philosophy find a common ground in many aspects, but a more careful observation has led me to the different roots under their seemingly same surfaces. Both Taoism and Cynicism advocate a life in harmony with nature, but their ways of seeking such a life are poles apart. Chinese Taoists find their haven in the countryside or other remote places, away from people but close to nature, whereas cynics choose somewhere prosperous and populous to live, maintaining their own stoic lifestyle, regardless of the chaotic environment and sneering eyes on them. For example, while Five-willow Gentleman settled down in the country and enjoyed the quietude, Diogenes fit himself into the nosiest city center and took all the ridicule around him as a joke. Basically Taoists are recluses and Five-willow Gentleman was just a good representative of them. Diogenes, on the contrary, belonged to the city. However, there are also Taoists living in the city but keep unaffected by the clatters and clangors of city life. Why is that? Thatâ€˜s because they dream away and use their wild imagination a lot. As is shown In Tao Yuanmingâ€™s another famous poem Drinking Wine: In people's haunt I built my cot; Of wheel's and hoof's noise I hear not. How can it leave on me no trace? Secluded heart makes secluded place. (çµå»¬åœ¨äººå¢ƒï¼Œè€Œç„¡è»Šé¦¬å–§ã€‚ å•å›ä½•èƒ½çˆ¾ï¼Ÿ å¿ƒé åœ°è‡ªåã€‚ Translated by Xu Yuanchong) Chinese people tend to be Taoists instead of Confucians, due to our national character as being idle and imaginative. Except for a few who are really ambitious and work hard, the rest of us are idealists, lazy and fond of dreaming. Iâ€™ll bet Five-willow Gentleman was a dreamer too. He liked wine, and every time he had a chance to drink, he indulged himself in it, then, I guess, he would enter a beautiful dreamland, in which he melted into nature without being hounded by the reality. What about Diogenes? He was by no means a romantic, for he rejected all human desires and supported a rigorous lifestyle. I figure he dreamed naught and had no wonders at the mystic nature, contrary to Five-willow Gentleman. Diogenes and Five-willow Gentleman both dislike the prevailing lifestyle at their times, nonetheless, they defied it in different ways. Five-willow Gentleman chose to hide away from people, being nonchalant about peopleâ€™s strife and the nationâ€™s crises. He kept a low profile and had no intention to heal the world by converting other peopleâ€™s religions. If somebody questioned his belief or mocked his religion, he would just give an indifferent smile and said nothing back in his face, even though he might have laughed at that manâ€™s stupidity in his mind a thousand times. Thatâ€™s why he was called a â€œgentlemanâ€. All in all, he just didnâ€™t care. Diogenes, though claiming apathetic to the society, in fact was desperate to change it into his way. He wandered in the crowded market place, acted in a conspicuously weird way in the sight of almost everyone, and threw laughter and abuses at them, if they ever dared to sneer at him. To my mind, the underlying reason for his actions was his desire to show dissatisfaction with the common way of life, and to awaken the â€œsleeping massesâ€. He not only cared, but cared deeply. So, despite their similar appearances at first sight, Diogenes and Five-willow Gentleman were actually not the same. Maybe the differences should ascribe to their respective cultures."

Mandarin,"historyï¼Œ learn or not learnï¼Ÿ Human being has come a long way in terms of finding breakthrough in incurable disease and technologies. The achievement gained from innovation and creation make people think that it would be wasteful of time to study history, because, on the surface of it, events happened in the past are not as valuable as what will happen in the future. There is no doubt that given the certain amount of time spent on a innovation programme, more time spent on studying history simply means less time on creating and experiencing. For example. If Apple company contributes its most of time on learning their footprints rather than devoting in to new thinking and customer experience, Apple may find itself being caught in the stage where not not be able to progress and gain more market value through its less attractive products. In addition to, some principle and custom laid in the past may not be applicable in the modern society. For instance, in the past, woman was not allowed to do the same things as man do, whereas, as the massive democratization in egalitarian, man and woman should be put in the same footing. However, ignoring the influence of history can bring us no benefits, we may not be able to replicate the success from the history, but, at least, we can avoid the same mistakes and tragedies from happening again. For example, what we had seen time and time again was that war-torn countries and people suffered from the pain of dissolution of family and loss properties. Can we resolve the disputes by learning the causes and ramification from history? Yes, we can. Because if people from different nations can learn each other 's history, it would not only allow people to understand the similarities between them rather than worring about the differences, but also reduce the chance of confrontation. In turn, by embracing different cultures, with the benefits of hindsight, should probably have seen many possible fights being vanished. In conclusion, Winston churchill once said: The further backward you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see. We can do a better job then our ancestor, but only if we learn from them in relation to their success and failure."

Mandarin,"The clear way of donning vocaloid cosplay fancy dress costumes causes you to a personality which signifies your personal style What is cosplay? Actually, it is a carrier to combine the field costume as well as engage in, so that you can outline cosplay as ""dressing right up as being a persona pertaining to fun"". Several cartoons, online game, sci-fi, and dream conventions delightful costumed people, and yes it can be quite a wide range of enjoyment to wear up as a well liked individuality with an function. Cosplay includes not merely anime plus game-related costuming, but in addition attire as characters from Videos, sci-fi Television for computer series, musicals, as well as original styles. The largest explanation pertaining to cosplay can be ""wearing a dress-up costume inside public"". The way in which I do believe of the usb ports, you could find 2 kinds of cosplay: dress up just like a character, and donning a fancy dress. Outfitting being a individuality suggests that you will be putting on some design of after that possibly be deemed typical outfits. It is deemed an ensemble which you can certainly don in public areas without having having so many bizarre appears to be.

Mandarin,"Aunt Lu In my Reading& Writting course, I studied Predictable Crises of Adulthood, written by a U. S. writer. She divided life in several stages and concluded character of each stage. And the writting task of this essay is to write a composition of somethone who can fit roughly into the development ladder intorduced by the U. S. writer. The following is my essay. ******* When my mum talks about her former days, a name is often referred to. That is auntie Lu. She is a close friend of my mum. They have known each other since they were at primary school. They attended the same primary school and the same high school, and graduated from the same college. When they were kids, education in China is not compulsory. It was not uncommon for children, especially girls, to drop school. As the eldest child of a poor family, her parents always suggested her stop going to school to help housework. When she was in high school, her mother was ill. Auntie was so desperate that she told my mum that she really had to end her study and help her family this time. My mum was also very sorry. At that time, they two were the only girls who went to high school in their village. And the nearest high school was in another town. Without auntie Luâ€™s company, my mum had to conquer the long journey alone. But at the beginning of the next semester, my mother was happy to find auntie Lu again. However, they still couldnâ€™t go to school together. Auntie Lu had to do so much housework that she couldnâ€™t attend school on time. Thus, my mum had to go ahead. Although it was very difficult, auntie Lu did finish her study and was admitted by a college. When she graduated from college, she got an assigned job, working as a doctor in the village. There, she met her husband, a school teacher. They got married and had a daughter a year later. Life was simple and comfortable, and auntie Lu enjoyed it very much. But after about 5 years, auntie Lu felt some changes were needed. In the remote village, life was inconvenient, income was low, and career development opportunity is few. What makes the change urgent is the problem about her daughterâ€™s education. She had to move to the village if she wanted to give her daughter a better education. Her family moved to our county when her daughter began primary school. My mum took me visit auntie Lu then. She lived in a rented flat, which was narrow and sparsely furnished. Auntie Lu was very happy to see us and chatted with my mother for a long time. She said although the current life is not easy, she was sure it could be improved in the near future. Auntie Lu was right. Because of her hard working and kind heart, she became a very welcomed doctor in the new hospital. She bought a big house 2 years later and adapted to her new life. One day, a pregnant woman came to her hospital alone. That woman was pale and sorrowful. Auntie Lu asked her what happened. Then she said her boyfriend discarded her and she did not think herself could raise the baby that was to born. Auntie Lu felt very sorry. When she backed home, she told her husband the whole story about the women. She also suggested that they adopt the baby. Her husband thought for a while and drew the conclusion that it would be great to have another child. So untie Lu talked the woman again. The woman agreed because she knew that auntie Lu can give the baby a more stable life. Days later, the woman gave birth to a boy and auntie Lu got a son. From then on, auntie Luâ€™s attention focused on her work and family. Life again began stable and auntie Lu was contended. In 2004, her daughter leaved home and went to university. Then, auntie Lu had more time for herself. She suddenly realized it was her chance to do something more for herself. Through internet, she found a hospital in Guangzhou was employing doctors. Although she was 41 years old, she would like to have a try. She persuaded her husband and went to Guangzhou alone. At the beginning, there are many difficulties. She was not familiar with the new environment and she missed home badly. But she insisted despite all difficulties. Now, after 5 years, things became much better. She brought a house in Guangzhou last year. But she is still not quite sure whether to settle in Guangzhou or not. She told my mum that depends on her daughter. If her daughter, who is now in the last year of post graduate study, will work in Guangzhou, then her family may move to Guangzhou. If not, she is probably to go back our county years later. But for untie Lu herself, the outside world is not that as attractive to explore as before."

Mandarin,"Be the way you are A recent movie recall my memories of like,eighth grade(the 3rd year in junior middle school)? We were assigned to write an article about dreaming. Then next week on the first period, the teacher was so furious to declare that she found someone's work was definitely the copies from outsiders' public paper. From thus,I confirmed that there is no such absolutely just recognization really happened so much so often. And to cheering up the creativity (of the piece of work which is goooood enough to be identified as a knockoff ), I thought I do earn myself a little more boast : people think and act in their routine, that's why they often hide their motivation and always persuade others NOT TO do sth beyond understanding. As time goes by,I find no matter what the truth is,people only see what they want to see. So, that will be a tough project to make everyone surround you do your interst without hesitation (PS: forgive my abuse of western language if it might be). They might strike you when you give a prospectus, they just say the opposite when the critical time comes,they can do anything abnormal and trust it or not,always accompanied by reasons. Is the way as similar as we conclude ?--if one sets his mind to do sth,sooner or later he can find his path & means . The point is we make mistakes,finding ourselves spending time in proving to others that we're not stupid which, on the contrary do the uselessness. The harder we try the more hopeless we feel. Time flies we all have to move on. We so bond to have because we are born with nothing and deny failure unconscious of the fact that everything begin with a trust. So... again,let's spare the time of acknowledging and do it though hard. Last month the Africa PD wanted to have a guy enrolled for him in response to the ""dissonance"" of the team. Saying this,I never think my english is good,I do not know what is the professional band 8 for,especially when you see so many graduates who was practicing language training from 7 just like us but still donâ€™t know how to extend it. And mostly,I figured all of the world,people communicate without useing word merely,itâ€™sâ€¦ sort of heart,perhaps. So like other stupid certification which I might wanna to gain through examination in Oct,I never think itâ€™s a must. Even that I do not speak the beautiful accent like 10years ago,even if I can not express myself clearly to win your support any longer,I just keep the right way I am,and I just believe everyone who has his own will be loved by his circle and destiny. I like the people who accept challenge and willing to explore his extrem. PLUS : this is supposed to be a talk big,but it's not. u r taking the risk of ignoring many so-ture experiences if you think it is."
Mandarin,"Solar total eclipse Tomorrow morning, most of people living in Changjiang River Basin will have a very rare chance watching solar total eclipse.

Shopping always makes me feel tired so I rarely go shopping except my friends' request for my accompany.~~~ However, shopping-on-line helps me a lot and I really appreciate this way. I love surfing on line for shopping and the numerous shopping-on-line websites in China provide me so many choices. I love buying pretty clothes on TaoBao and buying books on Amazone. I think these two websites save both my time and energy. However, shopping-on-line websites in China do have much to exalt themselves. I have been cheated before and from then on I become more careful~~!"

Mandarin,"tired I have lots of things to do and I feel a little stessful. Actually I have kept a busy life for nearly 2 years since I started my master's course. I want to learn more and I really worked hard. But I feel tired recently . Maybe because I feel hopeless about my future. It is too hard to get a doctoral degree in Japan. I have to use both Japanese and English for my study. It is difficult to get a schoarship, even I have got a paper published. I became narrow-minded because of my simple and hard life. Also, I think that Japan is not a good place for studying."

Mandarin,"7753_2 Stepping Out on the Way of Application Now it's July and I'm in the US, the issue of application, which I'd always evaded, is manifesting itself in its full form. Frankly speaking, I'm a total beginner about this matter. I had always been aware of the weight of the issue, but never got a starting point. People are always telling me, 'Search the Internet', 'Read books', and so on, but without a specific aim, I couldn't even make the first step. In a telephone call home this Wednesday evening, I asked Mom desperately for some items of information that could direct my searching. Finally she gave some suggestions at random, like the namelist of the professors, and the statistics of Chinese students' admissions, etc. Although I knew that it was little use to get just the names and numbers, but I was expecting to encounter something really valuable on the roadside. I started with the website of MIT. I did find a handful of numbers, but the visit didn't give me any other useful information. I felt discouraged. And I was doubting whether it was futile work to gather data from the official website from scratch. Surely some pioneers should have summarized such information somewhere. And starting from Google, I ended up in Baidu Knows, where a reply to a question on application said, 'Read Ten Talks with Taisha, then we can talk.' I've heard about Taisha before. It was a community that had something to do with the GRE test and the like. I decided to take a glimpse at the book anyway. And I seemed to have found the beacon. By comparing application to the marketing of a product, the book answered lots of questions that had hung uncertain in my head for months, or even years. Rather than applying for schools, I understood, we are applying for professors. So the most important thing is to know about and get familiar with the professors. There'll certainly be a lot of interaction; I'll have to pluck up my courage and take the initiative. Having read two talks of the ten, I felt that I was learning a brand new theory, and had an impulse to share it with somebody. But when I raised my head from the computer screen, I realized that the people around me, more or less, all knew more about application than I did. Even though they didn't necessarily know about the theory of marketing, they had already absorbed quite some information about the schools. Actually I was not a pioneer exploring a virgin forest, but just catching up with everyone else. I felt urged to go on. The third talk was about self-positioning. This is actually an essential issue that has always kept bothering me. Judging from what I've done, I indeed cannot be more ordinary; I do have a few achievements that could make others admire, but they are beyond the field of electronic engineering and therefore do not contribute to the possibility of my getting favored by the professors. But one night last month, I had discovered with the help of Mom that I could draw confidence from my down-to-earth attitude. However, I have to decide soon on which of these two mentalities I should base my application. It's gonna be a cruel spiritual battle. But anyway, I'm on my way."

Mandarin,"a psychological fator  As we all know , the housing price has remained at a high level for several years and it seems difficult to go down . Hence , many people become increasingly worried that they couldn't afford to buy a house in the near future. Under the pressure , more and more people manage to buy a house as soon as possible these days and make a larger demand for house market . As a result, it tends to pose scare-buying which may stimulate the housing price to go on soaring in return. In fact, i have heard something real from my uncle...... He ever said that because of worrying his son cannot afford to buy a new house which may be sold at a sky high price in the future, he preferred to buy one for his son first in spite of resorting to borrowing money and even maintain a loan . Of course, the rest money that should be paid for the new house will be in the charge of his son in the future. You see , my uncle just one example , and i think in the society there can be more parents take the same action as my uncle out of anxiety for the high housing price in the future. Such a psychological factor causing such behavior can be perceived as considerate for the next generation, but it can also contribute to raising the housing price nowadays. actually, this article is my English homework. It's part of an English presentation which topic is"" What are the causes for the sky-rocketing housing prices in the big cities? ""of our group. And i take charge of this part. looking forward to your correction, thank you!"

I don't like the weather here and I'm not accustomed with the taste of dishes,but I lbegan to ove it and want to try to adapt the life here when I saw the nice lightings that emit from the glass of buildings one night.

So I had a talk with my mother this afternoon. Mum said ""It is natural for people who do the same thing day in, day out to be fed up. You just need a rest now. Don't be guilty and worried. A good rest can make you have a happy mood. A happy mood can make your study more efficient than usual."" Mother's words is just like a small stream flowing over my heart and making me calm down.

Mandarin,"æ˜¯å¦èµžåŒæŠŠå¤§å…¬å¸å’Œå·¥åŽ‚æ¬åŽ»rural area Due to traffic congestion and housing problem, there is a trend that big companies and factories tend to move to rural area. I personally agree with the statement that moving big companies and factories serve practical and useful propose. Firstly, factories emit/produce exhaust gas, which pollutes the city air and damages people health. When the factories have been moved, the air quality in urban area can be improved. Secondly, relocation of companies will provide more employment opportunities to the rural area and it can make contribution to eliminate poverty. Furthermore, since the price of land in city center has been increasingly higher, with companies moved to countryside, the land can be saved for other purposes such as building hospitals or constructing a modern residential complex. However, moving big companies is not with its own downside. The employees may be reluctant to go to work at a place where is far from their house. The more disturbing fact is that some people may find themselves have difficulties in adjusting themselves to the new working conditions which leads to lower the productivity. Furthermore, the undeveloped infrastructure may fail to meet the demand of the modern production. In my conclusion, moving big companies and factories certainly bring enormous benefits, while the individualâ€™s choices should be respected."

I come from Si Chuan province in China. I was born in a small city. When I was a child, my mother always said I was a naughty boy. She wanted me to keep a quirt like a girl, even if it is only few minutes. I do not think so, because I thought boy is different from girl. When I studied in primary school, my teacher always said that Shay was a naughty and crazy student which she had never met. After graduating from primary school, I studied in high school where my mother taught math. In the high school, I found I was extremely interesting in math and physical. From that moment, I vowed I would be an engineer. Up still now, I have been attempting to achieve my dream. On the other hand, I like military so much. Extreme sports are all my another hobby.

Mandarin,"Meeting teacher Yesterday my daughter, YYâ€™s school had parents-teacher meeting. I left the work early to catch the meeting. I have asked YY earlier see if she has anything she want me to talk to teacher. She just complained the math is too simple to her. I know she have learned lot of math during the summer vacation when she was in Beijing with my parents. My mom was a middle school math teacher. She liked to teach YY math and she was happy to learn it. Before I went to see teacher I was thinking maybe they could put her in the higher gradeâ€™s math class, so she will have more challenges. YY is in grade 2 now and this was the first time I met her teacher. Ms. L. is a short Asian woman, probably on her 50s. She showed me YYâ€™s journal, math practice & English notebook from school. After one month school, Ms. L thinks YY is doing pretty well in the school in different areas which is good to hear. I brought up YYâ€™s math frustration. Ms. L explained to me that itâ€™s just very beginning of the semester and the plan is starting from easy level. Instead of simply asking kids to calculate 6 plus 8 she is teaching kids to use the math on solving the questions which are prescribed in wording. Kids have to read the questions carefully, come with an equitation and calculate the results. Ms. L has noticed a few kids are frustrated and claimed itâ€™s too simple for them. She tried to explain to them that this stage is focusing on the logical thoughts and they will get into more complicated math later. I got her idea but still asked her if itâ€™s necessary to put YY in the higher gradeâ€™s math class. Ms. Lâ€™s thinks following her pace for now might be a good idea for YY to shaped their mind to understand the math is a tool instead of just abstract addition & subtraction. I think she is probably right. Since YY is not a native English speaker I was wondering if she needs ESL support which she had in kindergarten. Ms. L said YY doesnâ€™t need extra ESL support anymore and her English is fine. She showed me YYâ€™s daily journal and told me YY is getting better on writing, but YY needs to learn how to write more complicated sentences. YY likes reading and I hope she will pick it up soon."

Mandarin,"IELTS writing though some people believe considerable proporton of rural students would put great efforts on learning,it is manifeast that there really is a phenomenon that rural students are to be more prone to difficulty of universities entrance. in my observation,universities should render these students assistance given the reality that distinction between different areas. it is evidently resonable for some to argue that the increasingly heavy burden of lives and finance impede the way they take fully time to be instruced. this is mainly due to the reality that the parent in country do not possess a good forturn and most time their children are commoned to do numerous household chore,however,the time originally should be assigned for them to review lessons learned. moreover,it is widely acknowledged that almost all the educational facilities are out-molded and many teachers here are substantially inexperienced and this,in turn,take students into a worse situation. those who feel that tertiary education should not make special easiness for students from country might argue that it would bring out educational inequality. even though,i have to emphasize the fact that it is commonly believed today rural students having been rendered in an inequality circumstance from their infancy onward. in consequence,this measure conducted by universities actually present educationally objective and balanced. in summary,to some extent,i would concede that sometimes there is a little inequality under the measure of priority for rural students. despite that,as an enlightened and obligated government,shold get this top priority to these originally disadvantaged students. overall,i am convinced that governments should invest in rural education increasingly high."

Mandarin,"Parents are the best teachers?? During our life time, we could have met various kinds of teacher. These teachers do not only including teachers in campus. Parents, grandparents, friends, even strangers could benefit us and be our teacher. Therefore, I personally disagree with the statement that parents are the best teachers. My point of view could list as follows. Firstly, the statement is way to extreme, parents might somehow influence children a lot, teach them all kinds of things. However, not all parents are good teacher. For instance, not all parents are highly educated, thus they might not have the ability to teach everything that their children need, even though they love their children deeply, there still are something they can do. Whatâ€™s more, a few parents might not well behavior themselves, which could have bad effect on their children. Secondly, the children was born with a natureâ€”the authority of teachers (school teacher). Teachersâ€™ education sometimes much more efficient then parents. When comes to learning something professional, school teachers have a big influence on children, they will behavior themselves, finish the task on time and with good quality. Further more, when children need to further their education, they need professional teacher to guide them. That is beyond parentsâ€™ capability. Thirdly, I think it is probably much more appropriate to say that parents are good teachers, well, most of them. Parents are the most important persons to children, every parent want to offer their children everything they can. No one could replace their spot. Parents teach children how to speak, walk and so many things with great patient. Keep them out of danger. Parents also teach their children the virtuous qualities of human behavior. To sum up, there is no question that parents plays an important role in childrenâ€™s life, and no such love could beyond parentâ€™s love to their children. Children could have met many teachers that could influence and teach them, parents just a part of them. Parents might be the first teacher of children, by no means the best."
Mandarin,"å´ç­±å‡¡ I am in one-side love with a girl named å´ç­±å‡¡. I declared my love by SMS several days ago, but was roughly rejected. She said ""no possibility"", which broke my heart desperately. But I still love her so much. I don't know what to do now, so I keep sending more messages without any reply. I know one day I will change her and get into her heart, and what's I am wondering is that how soon it can be ================================= minicat, I am unlucky that I didn't know it earlier. The fact is I am already deeply in love, and the worst thing is that I can change it. mdspencer ,all you suggestions are full of wisdom. I am just afraid that if I don't send the messages, she will soon forget about me. She don't want to talk to me in class now.( by the way, we are classmate in college.) I know I am stupid to have declared it so early without enough communication with her. I hate myself. virtually, I don't know how to change her attitude towards me. What I am doing is only encourage myself that with constituent effort, there can be something for harvest.. ============================ I know I was to eager to speak out those stupid words, and I have reflected my faults for times. But it's not the time for me to regret and denounce myself. It's definitely the truth that she is to ideal in my heart for the lack of communication between us. I am thinking what's the best for me to do next, which may change some of the current situation and both of us more understandable and transmitable to the other one. Of course I am trying to manage my own problem, thus those days I spent most of my time on study instead of thinking of her. Maybe if I am more knowledgeable and smart, she can feel the brighter perspective of my life and think higher of me. ---------------------------- I am afraid that she is not capable of doing the blocking stuff because of the lack of technical knowledge. But certainly she can ignore most of them, which I hate and worry about most. So I demand myself to send less and so that the messages can be more effective. I have lots of good friends in my class and they help me. Even the girls in her dormitory bedroom offered their help. But in fear of his losing of feeling of security, I don't depend on them a lot. Maybe all I need to do is to insist. Thank you two gentlemen."

Russian,"[EspaÃ±ol] La corrida La corrida es un espectÃ¡culo exclusivamente espaÃ±ol. Se celebra desde tiempos antiguos y durante su historia ha cambiado bastante.

Antitaurinos luchan contra corridas creyÃ©ndolas crueles y agresivas. Debido a protestas antitaurinosÂ Barcelona y la regiÃ³n de CataluÃ±a declararon la prohibiciÃ³n de corridas. En cambio, la gente taurina aprecia corridas y sabe disfrutarlo.Â El ordÃ©n de acontecimientos durante la corrida es como asÃ­. En los principios de la corrida el toro y el torero se encuentran cara a cara. DespuÃ©s vienen los picadores a caballos. Ellos estÃ¡n bien protegidos y su misiÃ³n es herir ligeramente al toro para que estÃ© mas dÃ©bil y el torero pueda luchar con Ã©l.Â DespuÃ©s aparecen los banderilleros quienes fatigan al toro clavando las banderillas. Luego empieza la faena de la suerte de muleta y posteriormente el matador le da muerte al toro con el estoque.Â El responsable por todo lo que sucede en la Plaza de toros es el Presidente de la corrida.

Russian,"Audible for Android Some weeks ago I signed up for audible. com to get the audio books in English language, so I could practice my comprehension of the spoken English. After that I learned, that I need a special MP3 player to be able to listen to the audio books from that internet site. I was very upset about this surprising condition, because I've already had 2 MP3 players, which were of no use for that purpose, and my Android mobile phone was not supported either. Actually I was able to listen the downloaded books only on my PC and it wasn't really an option. But today I found out that there is an Audible App for the android phones!"
Russian,"... People like adventures. They know that some of them are risky, but that is what attracts people most. In anticipation of a good time, sometimes we forget to think about notifying somebody where we are going, or taking a health insurance with us, or renewing it. We like to see only positive pictures of our adventurous trip in our mind. Unfortunately, in reality sometimes problems occur regardless of our desire. A couple of years ago, my friend Lona was invited to go skiing in Big Bear. Since she was on vacation from work and was actively thinking about a place to take a rest in, and nothing was coming to her mind, she was more than happy to accept the invitation. Upon arrival at Big Bear, the weather was beautiful. It was sunny and cool with a refreshing slight wind, only thirty seven degrees all day. It looked like the perfect day for skiing. At first, her friend and she checked into their hotel. Then they went straight to the mountain slope to attempt to ski down the mountain. They spent an hour together having lots of fun skiing until Lonaâ€™s friend got exhausted and was ready to go to the hotel to get some rest. On the other hand, Lona was still full of energy to continue her attempts to conquer the mountains. She decided to stay there a little bit longer. At some point, she realized how many handsome men there were. Catching some looks at herself, she started smiling archly in return. She was so flattered by the attention from the men that she stopped looking ahead. Suddenly, she found herself flying down the mountain uncontrollably. She lost her balance, fell, and crashed into a small pine tree. Soon, some guy approached her to ask if she was okay, but she was not. As it turned out later, she had broken her spine. Someone called 911 and after some period of time people in white scrubs were there to help her. The damage of her spine was very serious. She needed a surgery. The cost of it was way more than she expected it to be: fourteen thousand American dollars. The problem was that she forgot to renew her health insurance and now she had to pay the full price. She did not have that amount of money on her at that moment. What made the situation even worse that she had left her cell phone in her hotel room. It was 11 pm and Lonaâ€™s friend started to worry about her. When the clock hit twelve, her friend took action and called the local hospitals to find out if Lona was there. She spent hours calling and finally, one of the hospitals confirmed that lona was there with broken spine. Luckily, her friend let her borrow that amount of money and she got a surgery. It could have been less expensive if Lona had renewed her insurance plan. Her friend could have found her much more quickly if she had taken her cell phone with her. Lona learned the lesson. Now she is more responsible when it comes to traveling, and you?"
Russian,"Babies Recently I watched a fine documentary by French director Tomas Balmes. Itâ€™s called â€œBabiesâ€. I recommend you to check it out:) The film shows the growing up of 4 children, from their birth till approximately 1,5 years old. Those children are from absolutely different cultures: Japanese, American, Mongolian and wild African ones. Itâ€™s very interesting. I have quite big experience of being very small thanks to Holotropic Breathwork so it was even more interesting for me because I could have felt what those children really experience. Children experience incredibly strong feelings every single moment, most adults donâ€™t experience anything like that during all their lives. I think that itâ€™s a cause of lots of problems, people have a possibility to be passive and they make the most out of that and donâ€™t overcome anything REALLY hard. But itâ€™s a too big topic to talk about:)"

Russian,"The Moneychangers by Arthur Hailey I'm reading The Moneychangers by Arthur Hailey. This book may seem dated in terms of banking technologies, but ethic and social problems discussed in this book are still hot, and they become even hotter since global recession is not overcome yet. One of the topics discussed passionately in the book is credit cards. Credit cards are omnipresent in the Western world, but they are far from being popular in Russia still. When my husband and I moved to Canada, we learned that one's credit history is a synonym of one's reputation. They want you to build up your credit history as soon as possible. You may live in your own and need no loans from bank, but you should have a credit card and make purchases with it, because auto dealers, land lords, insurance agents and whole lot of other people and institutions want to check your credit history before they start dealing with you. Can you imagine that in 1975 people thought about ethic aspects of credit cards? Here is the quote: â€œ... thousands of people who shouldn't are piling up long-term debts by using credit cards. Often it's to buy trivia â€” drugstore items, music records, bits of hardware, books, meal, other minor things; and they do it partly because of unawareness, partly because small amounts of credit are ridiculously easy to obtain. And those small amounts, which ought to be paid by cash,add up to crippling debts, burdening imprudent people for years ahead.â€ The major difference between 1975 and 2010 is that today, everybody is taking credit cards for granted and refuses to think why the interest rate for a regular loan is a single digit number, while interest rates for credit cards are about 20%. â€œThousands of Canadians are blind to see their personal bankruptcy coming,â€ an advertising in the Toronto subway said. This is so true, also the fact is that the society that used to live in debts, is blind to see the direct connection between the system that force you to have a credit card and the impressive amount of personal bankruptcy cases. Dialogues about the economic situation of the United States sound like being taken from today's newspapers. Here is another quote: â€œThereâ€™s also more debt that can ever be repaid; debt thatâ€™s expanding like a monstrous bubble. American governments have spent billions wildly, borrowed insanely, piled up debits beyond believing, then used the printing press to create more paper money and inflation. â€¦ When will people relearn the lesson that there isnâ€™t any easy debt? i tell you? as a nation and as individuals, Americans have lost what they once had â€” financial sanity.â€ Arthur Hailey depicted this 35 years ago. What I've seen in the North America this Summer was tired people who are afraid to lose their work not because they love it, but because they have to pay their bills. You need a place to live â€” no problem, a bank will give you a mortgage. You want a new car â€” no problem, you may get leasing or financing. You may get everything right here and now, but because of the interest rates, you'll pay twice and thrice for all this. The whole system works in this way that you have no time and no will to stop and think about what's going on and how it comes so that you are in debts and will pay quite a big share of your earnings to the bank during the rest of your life."

Russian,"""The market is weird.

Besides my main work I have another source of income. I invest in stocks. I don't have a lot, but it's interesting and I do have a economic education after all. Of course I'm not a professional, so... it's like a hobby. Also it is very interesting to watch how the world's news (whatever- good or bad, political, economic, social etc.) affects the market instantly! As you know Russia has a very perspective stock market, especially talking about natural resource companies. I began this business over one and a half years ago, when the stock markets all over the world dropped because of the economicsâ€™ crisis in the world. And the prices were low - so the moment was perfect for entry. And now a trend is growing and we have positive thoughts and hopes. But in my opinion, if there is no real strong economy, if factories donâ€™t produce goods and people don't buy goods... Then there is no way for the economy to grow. I want to say that the stock market doesn't reflect the real situation in the economy of the country. Quite the contrary- instead of buying shares, people could actually invest their money in real production. But now it's like money from the air, and it's strange in modern conditions. So, maybe someday the stock market will be only history? )))"
Russian,"Iâ€™m confused This December Iâ€™ve passed a B1-level exam in German at the Goethe Institute. My parents were really proud of me, but they also immediately wondered, if there were such an exam in English as well. â€œWhy havenâ€™t you taken a similar Exam in English? Youâ€™ve been learning it all your life so that you are sure to pass the CAEâ€ In fact, Iâ€™ve contemplated that myself, but having looked through the sample papers I realized that I still have a long way to go. Not that I knew the language badly, but some tasks like Open Cloze or Writing tasks seem really challenging. The next exam is held in March 2011 which means that I donâ€™t have that much time to get prepared. But they wonâ€™t stop insisting on my filling in the registration form. I have admitted to my parents that Iâ€™m simply afraid of failing the exam or(which is just a little less humiliating) getting a low grade. Each time I try to drop that topic. The answer always is: â€œAt least itâ€™ll be a valuable experience for you, youâ€™ll be able to try againâ€ If only the really thought that way. I know, what they think is: â€œOf course youâ€™ll pass, you just have cold feet, we believe in youâ€. Now it seems that Iâ€™m really taking that exam this spring. This is bad news for me taking into consideration that I was going to try B2 level in German. Now Iâ€™m it for a hard time!"

Russian,"Dostoyevsky Fyodor Dostoyevsky is one of the most famous and important Russian writers and thinkers. In addition, heâ€™s one of my favorite writers. He was born on the 30th of October (or on the 11th of November in Julian calendar) in 1821 in Moscow. By the way, thereâ€™s a supposition that his father was Belorussian. He (I mean his father) was educated in 1828 and was a physician in a Moscow clinic. In 1831-2832 he bought a little estate and was known for cruel treatment of peasants. The mother came of a merchant stock. Fyodor was the second from seven children in the family. When Dostoyevsky was 15 his mother died of consumption; and the father sent the eldest brothers Fyodor and Mikhail (who became a writer afterwards either) to a boarding school in St. Petersburg. The year 1837 was a very important date for Dostoyevsky. In this year his mother died, it was also the year of Pushkinâ€™s death (Pushkin is the most famous Russian poet) whose works had used to carry away Fyodor and his brother since they were children. In that year Fyodor also moved to Petersburg and entered the Military Engineering-Technical University. In 1839 he received the news that his father was killed by serfs. Fyodor took part in work of ÐµÑ€Ñƒ Belinskyâ€™s circle. It was one year before transferring to the reserve when Fyodor translated a book by Balzac. IÐµ was published in the same year. In a year the 1st book written by Dostoyevsky called â€œPoor Folkâ€ was published. He becomes famous at once. Belinsky appreciated the work very highly. However, the next work â€œThe Doubleâ€ had lack of understanding. Soon after â€œPoor Folkâ€ was published the writer was arrested for a participation in a revolution group. Although he denied the imputations, court declared him as one of the most important criminals. To be continued...:)"
Russian,"North Advantage I have been in my native city in the end of October. Itâ€™s situated in the North behind Polar circle. At present time many people in the world are interested in the North.

Russian,"Please, help me! Corect my Russian English! ^-^ It is known that Bruce Lee could pierce a hole in the can of Coke ( that time those cans were several times firmer), and 24 frames per second camcorder couldn`t reflect all the movements of his hands-0,05 of a second for a DELIEVERING A BLOW. But it is not only for his talent for martial arts but he could incarnate on the screen the image of the fighter, master, who devoted his life to kung-fu. For millions of people he became a model, because of him many people on the West started practicing kung-fu. Bruce Lee was born the 27th November, 1940, in San-Francisco, the USA, during his parent`s guest performances: his father was a comic actor. According to Chinese moon calendar he was born in the year of Dragon, and the time from 6 to 8 a.m. is the Hours of Dragon. He was the most restless in his family; he has wild, unbridled, amazingly alert character, which was the reason of his incredible misbehavior. His mother called him Mo Xi Tong (never staying along in one place). The only one thing which made him quiet was reading books. His father considering that quiet taiji would pacify savage temper of his son made him practicing it. But it didn`t work. He wasn`t fond of science, didn`t have remarkable success in studying and bore a great aversion to Maths , this fact in aggregate with his â€œasking for troubleâ€ character became the reason forced him to switch several schools. â€œThe spirit of a fighterâ€ showed itself in his early years, he was looking the opportunity to fight, and he wanted to assert himself. His authority among boys was unquestionable. But one day he met a foeman worthy of his steel, who was a very skinny 13-year boy. Bruce was self-assured but suffered a defeat."

Russian,"Value of music Hope you will enjoy the reading, and I will enjoy the corrections ^_~ _________ From simple folksongs to a complex symphony orchestra, music has been created by every known society. However, music does not seem to help us to live longer or pass our genes more efficiently. Neither is it a primary mean of communication, unlike language. Psychologists might say that this form of art speaks to the heart. The evidence of that music corresponds to certain emotions and even induces the new ones is startlingly direct. Therefore, music accompany every pivotal occasion in our lives, whether it is joyful like wedding or sad such as a funeral. It taps into the mind and forces into the trance or ecstasy otherwise. In such a way it helps to endure the pain from self-torture during the bloody religious feasts, which are practiced in Thailand Vegetarian Festival, for example. Today, however, music tends to internationalize and becomes similar in a number of countries that I consider an inexcusable waste. Music industry is oriented to average consumer and aim to sell as many compositions and recordings as possible, destroying the essence of music itself. The result of that is soulless, down-home background tune. On contrary, the traditional music has a millennial history, which includes the history of every particular nation and folk wisdom. Furthermore, the meaningful lyrics it has teach us the overall values of life. In conclusion, the role of music is undeniably huge and it goes without saying that the value of national music is a head taller than music of â€˜public useâ€™."

Russian,"Music What kind of music do you listen to? As for me, I'm fond of rock music. I like different kinds of rock music, but especially hard ones: metal, grunge, industrial and so on. My mother was a fan of such classic hard rock bands as Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Rainbow, Uriah Heep and Queen. She was the one who opened for me the world of good music. And I'm grateful to her. Nowadays I vastly expanded my list of groups I listen to, but this was my first step. Lately German rock attracts me: Rammstein, In Extremo, Doro Pesch, Mantus, Puhdys, Die Toten Hosen, L'Ame Immortelle. I think German language is very beautiful and well sounds together with hard music. Besides, I know some good French, Turkish, Russian, Brazilian, Spanish, Ukrainian, Belorussian rock bands.

Russian,"My Prague journey Hello, everyone who is reading my scribble right now! I need your help with my another homework. I must prepare a short speech about my travelling experience. So, here I go! I have been to Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, two years ago. I was travelling by coach with the group of tourists and guide and I need to admit that this sort of travelling - crowded bus, constant bustle and hurry is not what I really like... But anyway, somehow I managed to enjoy my little adventure in toto. The first thing we saw was Old Town, the oldest of the towns of Prague gained the privileges of a town in the 13th century. And of course our group came to see the medieval Astronomical Clock or Prague Orloj. The Astronomical Dial shows the medieval perception of the Universe: the Earth is the centre, the Sun rotates around it. Clock shows three different times: the Italian Time, the Central European Time and the Babylonian Time. Also the length of an hour differs according to the season. Every hour, then the clock is striking, some wooden sculptures begin to move and figures of apostles appear in the little windows, and after that the golden cockerel screeches in a funny voice (as I remember). Also they have French formal gardens, beautiful in theirs artificiality.(The guide headed us to the park to take a rest.) I saw an albino peafowl there :) The bird was absolutely gorgeous and it displayed nothing but boredom while we were trying to take some pictures. Eventually I separated from my noisy group and ran away to see Zoo and romantic Troja chateau. The most remarkable things about Troja chateau are the gardens - huge, bushes cut perfectly in geometrical shapes, fountains with crystal-clear water, and the garden staircase with statues representing heroes of Greek mythology. It was already evening then I entered Troja chateau and for my great delight the building was absolutely empty! I was walking on a ground floor, though. I after a few minutes I came across the large door with plate lettered 'Tartarus', I tried it and it fitted! I was stunned. There was sculptures of two Ancient Greek heroes thrown into the Tartarus - the Hell, the figures were massive, made of stone and the bright sunlight came from above."
Russian,"USSR part 1 Some facts about the USSR falling apart. Live in the USSR was paradise. To some extent, of course. I was a child back than, so maybe I couldn't get the whole picture, but from what I remember it was fantastic compared to what I had to experience later after the fall of the empire. I lived in a beautiful town called Sukhum in Georgia, USSR. It was a beautiful town on the Black sea. Everybody would love to live there. Everyday I went to school and had lots of fun after. My father worked in a secret research facility in a plasma something laboratory. I don't remember the name of the thing. He was the leading engineer there. My mother was a secretary to some director or sheaf of something in the same facility. We lived a 20-minutes-walk way from the school and about the same distance from the facility. Every winter we went on a small 2 week vacation in a small town in the Mountains in Georgia, in about 7 hours on the train and then 2 hours on the bus from Sukhum, for we lived in a place where snow was a real rarity. In the summer many relatives and friends came to stay at our place. In those times, every family had its own apartment or a room in an dormitory. In big cities there were lots of dormitories, but where I lived there weren't so many and many people lived in houses. You could buy a house, but you couldn't buy an apartment. An average house cost about two times an average car, and to buy a car an average Russian had to save money for several years like 8 or 10 years for you couldn't buy in credit for there were no credits in the USSR. There also were those who didn't have to wait for so long. They could buy a house or a car in no time with the help of their family. People usually got their apartments for free, but before getting one you usually had to wait in line for about 10 years or so. Of course, people paid for electricity,water, central heating and some very low rent. When you got your flat you had to register there, and the apartment became the place of your permanent residence. You couldn't easily change your place of residence, and you had to exchange your apartment with someone else for it was impossible to buy or sell apartments in the USSR. Exchanging apartments was a real trouble for those who wanted to move. Though, it worked well. You couldn't just start wanting to move to another town and the next day rent a flat there, because there were a bunch of laws against it. You had to register in the new town etc. This registration process was a real pain. Sometimes, you had to wait in the line for hours etc, and the system was quite slow and annoying. Another thing that every body hated was the deficit. It's when you go to a shop and there is almost nothing you can buy. Of course you can buy, but you need a special coupon. So there were coupons for almost everything like sugar, bikes, sausages etc. Even to buy a tea pot you needed a coupon. You work more you get more coupons. Of course, there were things you could buy without a coupon, but they were usually sold-out very quickly. I'm sorry for the long text. If you could correct even some sentences, I'd be very glad. Thank you. (to be continued)"
Russian,"Here are some capsules of short stories Footprints in the Jungle by W. S. Maugham In Malaya the author met the Cartwrights which were very pleasant people. Mrs. Cartwright was frank and quick-witted, but Mr. Cartwright. The narrator stayed at Gazeâ€™s, his friend, who told him the Cartwrightâ€™s story. Mrs. Cartwright was married to a man called Bronson, a handsome chap with a mind of a boy of 18, though he was clever enough. Mrs. Bronson invited a friend of them to live with until he got a new job, because for that moment he was unemployed and almost poor. It was Cartwright which fell in their company quite naturally. Back then the Bronsons had no children. Gaze told the narrator that Mr. Bronson was killed. It happened at night when Cartwright gone shooting to the jungle and Bronson cycled to Kabulong to pay his workers their wages. Police came to the mansion and said that there was a body of a man lying dead on the path that led through the jungle to Kabulong. The author realized that it was Bronson and he broke the news to Mrs. Bronson about what had happened. When the narrator, doctor and sergeant arrived to the body, they saw some footprints that showed them â€“ the Bronson and the murderer were acquaintance. Whoever had murdered Bronson hadn't done it for money. Meanwhile Cartwright took up the management of Bronson's estate and the murderer wasnâ€™t found. But itâ€™s almost obvious. But itâ€™s quite obvious, doesn't it? The Ant and the Grasshopper by W. S. Maugham The author met his acquaintance, George Ramsay. That man was looking very sad and gloomy and the narrator understood at once that Georgeâ€™s brother played dirty tricks again, as he knew him quite well. The Ramsays were respectable people and everybody thought Tom (the brother) would make a great career and in the very beginning he started his life decently enough: he married, went into business and had two children. But one day he announced that heâ€™d had enough and starting from that moment he began to enjoy the life: dropped his job out and left his wife. No one could refuse to borrow him money, since he was so charming and lively. Very often he turned to George who gave him once or twice considerable sums to start his own business, but every time he spent that money for nothing. Tom even begun to blackmail George when he rejected to â€œborrowâ€ him another sum and George had to pay again. Tom was young and happy at his 46 while poor George grew old and looked as he was 60 in spite of the one year difference between them. But George waited till Tom would be 50 and then, George thought, he wouldnâ€™t find life so easy. But eventually Tom married old rich woman who died in a couple of weeks after it and left him a tremendous fortune. In my opinion this story demonstrates the simple fact that people shouldnâ€™t interfere into each otherâ€™s lives or teach them lessons but live their own one decently. The happy man by W. S. Maugham One day the author was asked to give a man advice. It was a total stranger who read the book about Spain the narrator wrote. The man, Stephens, was a medical officer and he was woebegone because of his life where, as he thought, he didnâ€™t make anything useful. It was a little man, thickset and stout, of thirty perhaps, with a round face and twinkle in his eyes. So he asked if it would better to move to Spain or stay where he lived. He completely deferred to the author since he knew about that country more than anybody else among Stephens acquaintance. So the author response was that if he wanted to earn a good living so he should stay and if it was just enough to keep his body and soul together whatever his livelihood would â€“ he should go to Spain. The man went away and the author forgot about him very soon. Years after he came to a small village, Seville, that in Spain having a trifling indisposition for that time. Found an English doctor he recognized his old acquaintance, Stephens. He grew bald and fat but there was a smile on his face. The author found out that Stephen got divorced with his previous wife and now lived with an attractive Spanish woman. He didnâ€™t earn any money but finally found his own happiness in the backwoods."

Russian,"My learning experience The desire to learn is perhaps the most extraordinary necessity of a human. Moreover, the more one learns the easier he finds it to acquire good learning skills. And the more he practises his learning style the quicker he learns. Personally I have been learning English since early childhood. In those days all I wanted was just to know a few words so that to say just a few sentences in class. It was only in high school that I first felt the joy of learning a foreign languange. My first authentic resources were 'Three Men in a Boat', 'The Godfather', 'Great Gatsby', 'How to Steal a Million', ''Snow White and Seven Dwarfs'. It seemed like a miracle to be able to understand and speak a foreign language. Many years have passed since that time. I'm still learning English. Now that I am a grownup and know what my learning style actually is, I can learn a great deal more at a time. Having been motivated in high school I think I can hardly stop learning now as I believe there is no end mastering English. Thanks for yout help to improve this passage."

Russian,"Deliberation upon nuclear disarmament(composition). Part 1. Itâ€™s quite obvious that fear is the reason why some countries seek nuclear status. How can we condemn Iran for its aggressive rhetoric taking into account the USâ€™s open deliberation upon the possible military attack on the country? At the same time, Israel is widely considered to possess up to 200 nuclear charges. What state would put up with a situation when his open adversary can wipe it off the face of the earth? And the most unfair side to it is that little global attention is now drawn to this fact. The only achievable solution to the Isreali-iranian conflict seems to be mutual nuclear disarmament. A new Middle East treaty should ensure that neither Iran nor Israel has nuclear weapons or enrichment facilities, their entire nuclear infrastructure should be under IAEI safeguards, Israel is to finally join the NPT. Of course both Israel and the US are unlikely to welcome such a step, but his seems the only compromise left. And if Iranâ€™s determination to become a nuclear power results in the USâ€˜s starting an attack on the country it will undermine peace and security of the whole world. Similarly Iranâ€™s acquisition of nuclear status will give up for lost the whole period of successful force of the NPT."

Russian,"Essay. Older parents The topic was about reasons why people have children older, why is this happening and what are the possible consequences of that for the family and the society. There has been a rapid decline in early childbearing recently. Nowadays more women decide to postpone the pregnancy until the age of 35 and above. There is a variety of reasons to do so. First of all, to be competitive in labour market women and men put career establishment as their first goal. Also they may consider giving birth a particularly demanding commitment, and struggle to raise their financial security. Young people in their 20s and early 30s might be afraid of possible lack of psychological matureness. Obviously, the middle-aged people have wide life experience, sense of responsibility and are more reliable. Younger people may deem themselves not prepared for parenthood. Such a hesitation may effect severely on particular family and society in whole. The age difference between child and parent may be very significant, and cause constant conflicts, especially during the puberty age. Also there is a high possibility that elderly parents will leave their offspring orphans early. What is more, the children of older fathers are expected to have lower IQ results, and Down's Syndrome are more common among these children. Societal consequences may be especially harsh in developing countries. Because of inadequate pension provisions children play a crucial role in parents supporting, either financially or practically.

Russian,"""The pool of tears"" retelling ""Curiouser and curiouser!"", cried Alice (she was so surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English), ""I must be opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!"" And so it was indeed: she was now almost nine feet high and kept to grow up rapidly. ""Good bye, feet!"", for then she looked down they were almost out of sight, they were so far off, ""I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings from now on, dears? I'm sure I shan't be able to. I will by too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best why you can - but I must be kind to them"", thought Alice,""or they won't to go the way I want to go! Let me think: I'll buy them a new pair of boots every Christmas!"" And she went on planning how she would manage it. ""They must go by the carrier. And how funny it'll seem to sent a presents to one's own feet. And how odd the directions will look! Oh dear, that nonsense I'm talking!"" Then suddenly her head struck against the roof of the hall, so terribly tall she became. And she took the little golden key at once and hurried off to the little door. Poor Alice! It was the only thing she could do, is to lay down and look trough the little door with one eye. The things were worst then ever, so Alice sat down and began to cry again. ""You ought be ashamed of yourself,"", she said loudly,""a big girl like you (she might well say that), to go on crying! You must leave off this minute, I tell you!"" But she went all the same, shedding gallons of tears till there was a large pool around her. After a time she heard a pattering of feet and dried her eyes hastily to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit, splendidly dressed, with a pair of kid-gloves in one hand and the big fan in the over, trotting along in a great hurry. He was muttering to himself, as he came ""Oh the Duchess! The Duchess! Won't she be savage, if I've kept her waiting!"" Alice was so desperate, that she was ready to ask help of anyone: so, then the White Rabbit came nearer to her, she began in a low, timid voice ""If you please, Sir -"" but the Rabbit started violently, dropped the gloves and fan, and scurried away as fast as he could. __________ Vuala! The second chapter of ""Alice's Adventures...""! I would be glad if you checked it for me and explained what ""started violently"" means?"

Russian,"Only We ... Can you help me to correct my mistakes??? He was my dream. He was something that will never comes true. He was the most intelligent and selfish, the most desired and harmful, the most clever and crazy. We did not love each other. And for what? Usually love includes: gentle, care, sex, attraction and a little bit similar thoughts. And we had everything different ... We arranged debates on all the topics we've always proved our innocence, we always saved only our opinion, we have never come to an agreement. We forget our quarrels in 10 minutes. Exactly 10 minutes was enough for both of us to find a new reason to quarrel. I never worried about his health or problems, he couldn't care less where I am and with who,he never asked about my plans for the future. I never asked about his favorite movie, or about a girl with whom he was deeply in love. When we walked, he never asked whether I liked it. When we swore I never asked ""Forgive me, please"". Do you know why all this happening? Because we enjoyed being together, because we gave each other a splash of adrenaline, which no one can ever give us , because when we did something together we always helped each other, because we never kissed, because we never jealous of each other, because we needed it! Only We ..."
Russian,"Sledding I wasn't in the forest for ages. So, not so long ago me and my sister decided to go there and to sled. Oh, it was marvelously experience this feeling again! Firstly, we've chosen the highest ice-hill. By the time we'd reached the top, we were on our last legs. The time fun began! I sledded the first. Screaming and squealing on the corners I didn't notice how boy and girl appeared straight in front of me. I shouted that they moved aside but they ignored me! I tried to halt pressing the brake - the sleigh didn't stop. Then I tried to slow down with my feet - it worked! I could breath freely - nobody didn't suffer. Soon parents with their children and skiers arrived. One of the skiers came with his dog. He was very nice). When his owner was rolling down he was running for him. His long ears flapped when he was running and the snow flew out from his paws. But it was getting harder and harder to sled among crowd of people. That's why we went to another ice-hill. Natasha (this is the name of my sister) got into the sleigh and I carried her. From this ice-hill we went down together. I sat behind my sister. And I can't remember the last time when I laughed so laudly. I couldn't see many things because of Natasha's head and it always seemed that we'd run into the tree. Of course, we wouldn't. We went home when my sister said that she was tired. I was surprised because I sledded more often than she and I carried her in the forest. Although she said she would be glad to repeat it. I'm placet! In advance thanks for corrections."

Russian,"Rubbish and other fairy tales. Hi there. I'm here for the first time and I really don't know what I'm gonna write. Of course it's a great opportunity to improve my writing skills and help me with my English. Of bloody course. But what would help me with my total absence of talent? I suppose, it must be some kind of an inherent thing, you know. I can't remember anyone in my family smart enough to write books or... play violin and shake hands with Beethoven or Clode Debussy... Just Common people without anything out of the ordinary. To be honest, I hate this ""ordinarity"" if that is the word. To be like everyone else is equal to be Nobody or smth. But trying to become special makes one instantly such a fool which is equal to ""common"" and ,as a result, equal to Nobody. There are phrases . ""Nothing in particular"" ,""Nothing special"". What if we replace nothing with nobody? Certainly nothing would happen to you if you do so. Don't even worry about that. The thing is that I have to write smth, even utter nonsense. So here I go. I mean , what actually is ""to be special""? Not to be like anyone else? But how can I know for sure what people are, those ones whom I'm bumping into in the streets, swearing fiercely and wishing violently to see their tombs? How can I measure their ""specialness"" or ""nonspecialness""??? Of course one would say ""Everyone is special in their own way. What the hell are you talking about, poor chap?? It's 12 pm and you'd better go to sleep until something bad happens"" By something bad I actually mean every bloody thing that can happen to you at 12 o'clock at night. Vomiting, diarrhea, intrunsion of UFO, or fits of sexual neurosis... Whatever. ""I wish I was special... You're so fucking special... But I'm a creep... I'm a weirdo..."" Radiohead, eh? Well may be weirdoes are the only ones who remain special in their own special way? ""Nobody in their right mind would ever eat wasps plucking them out of their shoes (whose shoes - no idea) . But I'm doing this. 'Cause I'm a weirdo and I don't care. And even If I did I would still remain a weirdo"" And blablabla. Gorgeous post.

Here we go: _____________ Dear Sir or Madam, My name is Ksenya Troitskaya and I am writing to you in response to the advertisement for the employment section of Sunwell Entertainment official website. I enclose my English and Russian rÃ©sumÃ©s for your consideration. I became interested in the Player Coordinator work since Iâ€™ve started playing MMORPG and especially ClicheQuest. I had a chance to compare player support standards provided by different game companies (is it ok to call them ""Game Companies""?) and Iâ€™ve always enjoyed high-quality service from Sunwell team. My interest grew stronger as your company has started launching Russian servers and hiring Russian-speaking employees. (is it ok? They started hiring together with preparations to launch, not if they've launched them first and then started hiring) During my career I have had several diverse jobs, all of them required to work in a team and to deal directly with public.(Doesn't it sound stupid or too, I don't know, cumbersome?)I found my short-time but intensive work at Autotrade AG particularly valuable in teaching me the importance of ascertaining a variety of customers' needs and providing clear and accurate information in response to those needs. Being a part of Staff Empire recruitment agency has taught me the ability to work in a constant tensioned mode (is this ""mode"" ok? it was crazy time, always under pressure) and still being always available and helpful to (to? for?) both customers and candidates. Although I donâ€™t have any MMORPG working experience, some of my jobs required me to deal with Internet communities using appropriate tools including forums, blogs and some others. Also, as a hobby I managed (as a moderator, how to say this? Moderated? Not sure) some game community forums. I would be grateful if you could consider me suitable for joining excellent SunwellÂ team and offer a position of Player Coordinator at any location, France of Ireland. (isn't this too rude? ""Please hire me"") I would be available for abroad travels from the beginning of June (here I mean that my international passport will be ready by that time only, but maybe it's not necessary?), and I am available for interview at any time. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Ksenya Troitskaya ____ Is it hopeless? >_< UPD: changed names to some unreal."

Russian,"Something funny I was browsing in the internet and found some interesting things. However, I am not sure that everything is truth. Some British earl who lived in the end of XXVIII century was very famous of his game of chance liking. He could play cards for several days without stop. In order not to divert his attention out of the game, he ordered to bring him the bread flavored with something, a butter, for instance. The name of earl was Sandwich. When Dmitriy Shostakovich was at a party hosted by British Queen, there was served up a tea with lemon. After a composer had a tea, he took out a lemon from the cup with the spoon and ate it. The court was shocked, but not Queen. She imperturbably took her lemon from the cup and ate too. The incident became a precedent. Since that an etiquette allows to eat a lemon taken from the tea. Japanese scientists invented an invisible coat. It is made of materials, which reflects the subjects on the background. The camera transmits the video signal to the front surface of the coat. Due to this, a man fades in the landscape.(Hmm. Hmmm. Hmmm. If that so, when it will be available in the shops? And what will be approximate price for one unit?)"
Russian,"My small weakness I have a weakness. It will sounds strange, but i can not resist the sweet. Yes, i know the most people like to eat sweet, but i do not eat it because i be on a diet. I stick to healthy life-style and sports, but it was not always. In my childhood i momentally have eaten all the sweet which was at the kitchen and when i changed my ration i could not forget this beautiful taste of sweetness. I have remembered it yesterday, when after long being without food i saw many of sweets in the table. I could not resist myself and have eaten the most taste of them! Yes, it was wonderful and i was satisfied, but i did not eat sweet for a long time."
Russian,"6. asphalt finally read the book by Grishkovetz ""Asphalt"". well what can i say. it was rather nicely written and told, like all his works, about an average human who seems to be a reflection of yourself. but the most strange thing about Grishkovetz is the politeness with which he writes and speaks, especially writes. i don't know how it is possible to write so politely and nicely all over the book - even rudeness is polite with him. yet it was a little shallow - his performances i like more."
Russian,"my stupid summer ooh. I don't like when anybody ask me about my summer or 'how I spent my summer holidays'. It's not interesting. I mean, I hate to tell how I rest. Probably, It's seems so strange and weird. So, my summer was a little boring. I became older, now I'm nineteen. It's upsets me so much. Also, I don't like hot weather, I prefer cold and raining. Tastes are so different as you know. And finally, I understood, what I want from my life, but I can't tell you about it. It's personal, I think. But I'm glad that my summer was such stupid and may be boring, It doesn't matter. I understood that I actually had a pretty good time. That's all."
Russian,"One vivid trip Last winter I went to mountains with my friends. This trip was supposed to be a usual one but it turned out quite the contrary. At first the temperature in our hotel was rather low: we wore sweaters and jackets inside and couldnâ€™t dry up our wet ski costumes. It was nice that there was the hot water in the hotel that didnâ€™t let us freeze at least. The weather was excellent for skiing: sunny and clear. And we had been skiing all day long but when we decided to go to hotel, we found out that cabin-way had broken. A lot of people were made to use the cable-way which had a low carrying capacity. Because of that fact we got stuck in a huge turn for two hours. That day we became frozen hard and didnâ€™t fall ill only because of great dose of the mulled wine. The next day everything started in a good way: we had been skiing until noon, and then we had dinner and continued skiing. I fell behind my friends and went by the cable-away alone. And in the middle of ascent this unlucky cable-way broke down and I got stuck on it. The wind was strong and was becoming stronger; I couldnâ€™t feel my legs and hands. A lot of time had passed before the cable-way was repaired. After descending I met my friend in cafÃ© and the mull wine brought me back to life again. From that point everything was Ok: there were no mishaps and predicaments. We were skiing all day long and enjoy ourselves a lot. But it wasnâ€™t the end. On the path to home the bus heating broken down. As it was the night trip, everyone couldnâ€™t fall asleep. Thatâ€™s why we were so tired and exhausted the next morning. Ðs a result this trip might seem to be failed but I couldnâ€™t say so. For me it was an adventure with my friends which gave me a lot of vivid recollections and impressions, not as bad as it can look from the outside."

Hm... I guess most people like to gossip. Not everyone. For example, my friend Ksenia is unsociable and self-sufficient. It seems she's never bored when she's alone. So she really doesn't care about these small talks. Our classmates all know it. Last week at school Ksenia sat in the chair. She closed her eyes and relaxed. Suddenly she heard two girls, R. and S., who came and sat not far from the place she was. She could hear every word they said. They started to gossip and discuss some pieces of scandal. S. and R. didn't want anyone hear them. They stopped to talk when they saw someone coming nearer. Nevertheless, they didn't pay any attention to Ksu, though it was no doubt they knew she's been there: she waved them hello when they came. They just knew she had no care for gossips and felt free to chat while she's near. But they forgot she had a sick friend, who was extremely bored at home and was out for some news. She told me what she has heard. Don't judge us! Gossips are what the high school was made for. :D Here they are - benefits of being quiet and attracting little attention! --- Today on my English lesson we talked about these funny little sounds and their meaning: Err... = I don't know Oh... = That's annoying Oi = Stop it!

Russian,"My thoughts I find studing foreign languages easier than teaching someone your native language. When I study a language I know what my problem is, what I don't understand. When you teach someone you don't know what does he know in the language and what he doesn't understand. I talked with my English teacher from school. I remember how I began learning English. I was 8 years old. The first we began to study animals on English. Then we learned THE PRESENT SIMPLE. If I would be more hard to learn English in school now I known English well."
Russian,"bla # 14 Hi. Today I called up my first English teacher. I used to be her favourite pupil. I remember how I used to call her up every week in summer and asked her to teach my class :D I really love her. Obviously,it was she who implanted love for languages in me. I think,that relationship between students and teachers is pretty important. I have had a part-time job since the third of August. Ohh.. It's so boring-I have to dig up weeds and collect different trash. The worst thing about it is that I am supposed to get up extremely early. Actually,I made this decision myself so I shouldn't complain :D As I work with my classmates,today we were sitting back and reminiscing how we used to have fun in primary school. It's so pathetic especially because I am leaving my class in which I have been studying for nine years. Another job I am doing-I work as a courier at my mother's agency.

Russian,"novel ""Discovery"" part 8 Like all the children, I attended a school, which, in my case, was a few steps from my house. There we were taught various subjects, including absolutely useless ones. We also had to learn a great quantity of bizarre and obscure words... However, I happened to learn another one without even wishing so: scoliosis. I learned this curoius word during a regular medical examination of our school. Nevertheless, this defect didnâ€™t cause me any inconvenience. Though a little deviation was visible on the X-ray photograph, it didnâ€™t inluence my posture in any way. But, in spite of this fact, I was prescribed medical gymnastics. In a clinic, which was located in the street where I had never been before, existed even a special room for such purposes. I was there that I headed/made for. It should be noticed that there were a lot of parks all around these places and a factory that produced tyres. I cannot say exactly whether the trees defeated or not in the struggle that they carried on against this factory for pure air, but such a quantity of greenery was very pleasant to look at. However, during this month of May, not only this attracted my attention. What can a boy of fifteen think of? The answer is so evident that Iâ€™m asking myself if I should give it there. I will simply notice that besides a passion for the opposite sex, I was fond of reading. But you should not believe that I was a library rat: I did judo, played football in the yard of my house with neighbour boys, etc. Simply, shortly before described events, an interesting book had falen into my hands and aroused my interest for reading. But I will speak of that a little later."

Russian,"How to Keep a Stiff Upper Lip. The overwhelming majority of people travel for fun and relaxation, others set of for the sake of photos just to show off, still others leave their homes to expand their knowledge of geography. My case turned out to be unique as I happened to spend a month on learning how to keep your chin up. Indeed, what else can you do if you journey appeared to be a disaster? A few years ago I was invited to spend the following June in Greece taking care of a group children in a summer camp. My imagination conjured up a vision of a sunny day with brilliant blue sky looking down at the unruffled sea. It was so vivid that I could smell the hot air saturated with delicate fragrance of local herbs and flowers richly flavoured with the delicious aroma of roasted coffee coming from a cafÃ© nearby. I couldnâ€™t think of a better place for being idle and enjoying life to the fullest. The first disappointment I faced was at the airport where we got trapped in the shabbiest and cramped aeroplane, obviously constructed in the previous century. I managed to suppress a wave of panic when the plane eventually took off. â€˜Never mind!â€™ I told myself. â€˜Thereâ€™s something aheadâ€™. Little did I know about what lay in the future. What struck me the moment I stepped inside the tumbledown hotel was the understanding of how insignificant and vulnerable humans could be. Not having been used for long, the building fell in disrepair, no modern conditions provided. Not once was I on the verge of breaking down breathing in the musty smell the bedroom had about it. What added fuel to the fire was the fact that almost all the children had fallen ill leaving no chances for idling or strolling along the beach. At the end of the day I was amazed by how close we had become to each other. I felt as if I could have spent the remainder of my life in that sordid place only to see the childrenâ€™s faces around beaming and glowing with pride and excitement of helping each other. The only thing was left, the incredible aroma coming from the nearest cafÃ©, and this was this that made me keep a stiff upper lip."

Russian,"motorcycles Hi! Some day ago, while I was roaming through the Internet and found a book by Nick Einch ""Sport driving techniques"" (I didn't find it in English). It discussed everything about driving a motorcycle. Braking, steering, speed selection, possible mistakes, road dangers. Great book. It showed to me a great motorbike world. Bike is much harder than a car. For example, when I need to slow down on a traffic light when driving a car, I select lower gear and push brake pedal. ABS and motor do all things for me. To slow down bike you should slightly push down a rear brake, than, almost immediately activate front brake, also very gentle. After this you can activate front brake as much as possible. Also, while you do all this things you should select lower gear. All this things is to avoid wheels from blocking. If rear wheel will be blocked, the ""highside"" can happen - rear wheel's suspension will push rider out of the saddle. If front wheel will be blocked, raider left any control on the bike. By the way, I really want to ride a bike. It should be hard for the beginning, but it brings a lot of adrenaline and speed. At autumn I'll go to auto-school to get 'A' category driving license. There are some bike photos. http://autobm.ru/glr/%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%20%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9%20%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%D1%8B/126-1.jpg http://www.cycleworld.com/assets/image/2009/W28/070620091741059994.jpg http://assets0.smart.fm/assets/users/tmp120210/21f0d7e8.jpg after days of reading test-drives, reviews, etc. I found Kawasaki Ninja 250R.

Russian,"Modern inventions. I think that modern inventions are good. They make our life easier, but they case problems too. We all know how microwaves influence our body. The ecological situation is getting worse because of autos and factories. Teenagers spend all their spare time serfing the Internet instead of studying. That's why you have to think twice to buy a computer or a mobile phone your child or not, because it definitely will cause troubles to his health. You also have to read gadgets instructions before doing a purchase to avoid accidents."

There were so many people in the queue that when we went to the stage the festival had already started. At the beginning of it the weather was cloudy and there was no sun. But miracle occured then members of Ð§Ð°Ð¹Ñ„ (?) asked us to wave our hands to banish the clouds. And they've disappeared! How all people shouted and mafficked then K&C appeared! They always charge with energy the public. I sang their songs so actively so in the end of the day of singing I couldn't normally talk. Other bands were great too. Their members sang sincerely, and the whole audience knew their songs by heart and sang along. Skunk Anansie played extremely professionally. Their singer Skin even jumped in the crowd! I couldn't hear Tarja because my friends and I have frozen. That's why we decided to go home. In the end of the day we were feeling all in because we woke up at 5.30 a.m. and returned home at 11.30 p.m. Anyway, I was as happy as the day is long))))) http://zagony.ru/2011/06/17/rok-nad-volgoy-2011-25-foto.html"

Russian,"novel ""Discovery"" part 9 After a little bus trip pending twenty minutes and a few minutes of shady malls and sunny parks, I entered dark clinical corridor, where some children and adolescents were waiting for their lot/fate. I took my place on a backless seat near a girl who seemed to be of the same age as me. As the corridor was only lighted up by a little window in the end of it and as I did not dare speak to her, I only saw her vague profile that I looked secretly at. A large mirror occupied all the wall of the room in which we entered soon after my arrival. I saw myself clearly in the mirror as well as the young girl who seemed to me very pretty, but this spectacle did not last long. The woman doctor, either for observing security or for another reason, took away my glasses and put them down on her table promising to give them back just after the session. I was so surprised at this impertinence that I even did not have time to say a word. The following half an hour turned out plunged in the fog. If with my glasses I had been able to see perfectly a text written on a blackboard even from the last school desk, without them every object two metres away from me appeared to me to be nothing but a coloured stain. Until now I remember my sitting on a rug, opposite the mirror, in the middle of these unknowns among who I was feeling her presence: and also the light wind from a window, song of birds outside, soon we would have the school exams and after that would start the summer holidays... When I emerged from this fog, in other words when my glasses were given back to me, all of us were already in the act of changing from our sport shoes into casual shoes and because it took me a good deal of time, I went out into the street among the lasts. Outside, after leaving all these fogs and sombre clinical corridors, I was breathing with surprising lightness. What had been difficult in the darkness, seemed so much simpler in the light: I would only catch up with this girl over there, say words of greeting... It was precisely what I did. And I was fully recompensed with her charming smile and with all the charm of youth expressed on the face of this girl of fourteen."
Russian,"voices vs. instruments I was wondering, everybody knows there are low voices and high voices as well as instruments playing in low and high register. and the sound comes from something vibrating - a string as in a violin or air as in a trumpet. you pluck a thick string with a finger and get a low sound, say an E on the guitar (the 6th string). you pluck a thinner string and get a higher note, an A on the 5th string. or you hold the thicker 6th string on fret five, thus making it shorter, and, again, get the higher A note. so, obviously, the thicker and longer the vibrating body (string or air column), the lower the pitch. the thinner / shorter the vibrating body, the higher the pitch. that's why the strings on a bass guitar are thicker than the guitar's, or why the violin's are thicker and longer than the cello's. that's also why the trombone is straight and the tuba so twisted: to play as low as it does, it must be longer than the trombone, but you could not hold it in your hands if it were as straight. so, as it goes, size does matter. now, what I don't understand is the difference between human voices: how come men in general sing (and speak, too) lower than women, how come men sing tenor or bass, how come women sing alto or soprano, if we all are relatively the same size? I mean, you cannot say, the tall or the fat ones sing lower, and it's rather the size of just a part of your body it must come up to, where there is the less difference. well, I know, there is the air you breath through the throat, just like through the flute - is this where length or width differ? there are also the vocal cords, that vibrate under that breathing air as strings do under your fingers - are these so different in size? or is it something else I didn't come to think of? and even if there is a difference in size between a bass singer's and a soprano singer's organs, isn't it too damned small to produce pitch variations like this? I mean, look at the violin and cello. their playing ranges overlap: a cello can play in unison with the violin, the former's high notes are the latter's low ones, but that's alright. what I'm driving at, is their pitch is comparable, but their size is not. or take the two saxophones, soprano, the size of a clarinet, and baritone, bent in two halves and still reaching to the floor from a seated player's mouth. they both, too, can play several notes in the same pitch. whereas, my baritone voice (or bass, I don't know exactly which) cannot always sing a tenor's part, forget about an alto's. okay, I can't, this might be due to lack of professional training, but a singer who can, is celebrated rather as an exception, like my worshiped idol Bobby McFerrin. so, if you find an article explaining this in simple words or can put it in words of your own for a thankful word in return, you are welcome to come and open my eyes=)"

If it's serious then good-working bar-staff are going to be completely drunk in the end of their shift. Maybe they don't drink it on the work, and take it to their home? Then they have to have a lot of little empty bottles. This version don't look convincing. Maybe they sell it in the bar to next clients? Then why don't they take a money as a tip?

It was even easier to read that book because Iâ€™d gotten used to the Carrollâ€™s vocabulary. But there were lots of plays on words, it made things a little more difficult. There are many translations of the books about Alice into Russian. I wonder what they did with all those plays on words? I thought about possible ways to translate them into Russian while I was reading those books and found that itâ€™s often impossible! Actually, translations of poetry, books and movies sometimes are really awful. Especially movieâ€™s ones. When I see films in English translated into Russian Iâ€™m often really shocked about HUGE quantities really STUPID mistakes. Have you ever noticed anything like that?"
Russian,"Gossip Through the first paragraph of the short story named â€œGossipâ€ we make the acquaintance of the main character, Fred Battersby. He calls around on a number of married women and treats them equally, paying exactly the same amount of attention to each one. â€œWhat a womanizer!â€ we may infer. But further the author gives a detailed description of Fredâ€™s visitings. He is a middle-aged widower with a pleasant face which inspires to trust him. Being conscious of what ladies want and capable of giving them what they need, Fred devotes himself to their problems and he indeed likes it. Moreover, he is such a rare man, who not only enjoys being with a women, but can understands them. And he is very good at it. In other words, he does the things which husbands are supposed to do: listening to wivesâ€™ problems, giving compliments and making them feel essential, helping them out and taking an interest in their doings, even sometimes flirting with them and amusing them. The ladies appreciate Fred and they are always looking forward to his visitings. But his calls do not go unnoticed and eventually cause rumours to spread through the small village, where it is impossible to hide any secrets. Propelled by the idea of keeping welfare and morality in the town, the older village women, thinking of disclosing Fredâ€™s affairs, backbites him. The worst of these gossips, Mr. and Mrs. Summershams, unfortunately have not only long tongues and desire to maintain the â€œorderâ€, but also resources and power to do it. The atmosphere of distrust grows up, and thereupon the Summershams motive the director of company where Fred works to dismiss him. He has nothing to do but move to a nearby village; the scandal is subsided, delighted gossips and offended husbands calm down. The peace has settled not for long. The ladies, bereft of Fred, begin to find a replacement, but noting can substitute his former rounds. And that leads to real cheatings, divorces and new wave of worse rumors. The story is centered around gossiping and backbiting. And the main message of the story is â€˜avoiding rumoursâ€™, which is strongly highlighted in the concluding words. This story is a vivid example of gossiping with all its terrible and irreparable consequences. Particularly when it comes to people with power, who can act, being guild only by unreliable hearsay information. On the other hand, it partially tells about husbands, wrapped in theirselves and therefore unable to pay necessary amount of attention to their wives. The main character Fred, calling round on the women and absorbing all their negative energy, helps to avoid important problems and keeps the families safe. He is definitely a man of merit. Thus, I suspect, it also contains a message to each of husbands, who after reading the story should reflect upon it and a situation in his own family."

Russian,"First post. Hello, world! :) Today I'll try to tell you about russian system of education. This theme is very close to me: i have graduated institute last year and going to enter a post graduate course. Russian system of education is being reformed nowadays: from our own system, we are coming to the Bolognese system. Let's start with russian original system. In Russia (and other in former soviet republics) we divided education into several main stages: elementary school, secondary school, higher school and then science degrees are coming. Elementary school consists of three or four forms (from first to fourth. Fourth one can be omitted ), secondary school consist of five forms (from fifth to ninth). I would say, higher school should be divided into two main part: two highest forms in schools and five or six years of institute (or university). After elementary school pupils are able to read, write, count. After secondary school pupils can do everything mentioned above, their math skills are hardened, they should know basic physics, chemistry, biology, at least one foreign language, geography, history and may be some basic philosophy. At this point pupil get high education. Many people stops at this point: high education is enough for life ;) Almost everyone in Russia graduates from high school. Higher school is much more difficult to enter and to graduate. So it was very prestigious to have higher education. Nowadays bribery prospers everywhere, so higher education lost most of its prestige. Nevertheless, after higher school you receive a title of a specialist. As a specialist you are considered to be able to solve difficult abstract and applied problems, to be skillful at your speciality, to be able to do economic forecast, concerning your projects. But in every institute or university students learn a wide range of sciences. For example, as an engineer (a programmer), I had to learn russian language (a bit), philosophy, an arrangement of semiconductor devices, theory of problems solving and many other thing, I don't really use in everyday work. Last term in higher school is almost totally devoted to a degree work. In this work you should propose some minor improvement of something already invented (can I say ""being used""?). After higher school students can go for a higher academic degrees. In russian system these are ""candidate of a science"" and ""doctor of a science"". In brief, to become a candidate of a science, you have to compose existing things, ideas to a some new system, to archive a solution of a fundamental problem. To become a doctor of a science, you have to propose something really new to the science (or convince everyone, that you proposed something new). Next time, I'll try to write something about novelties in russian education. P. S. I didn't expect, I would need a dictionary so many times."

Russian,"The Lovely Bones. Alice Sebold. The life after Susie Salmonâ€™s death, the ordinary girl with mousy brown hair, is the central event of this story. She was fourteen when she was murdered on December 6, 1973. Her murder was a man from their neighborhood, Mr. Harvey. The tense plot overlaps with a miracle place called Heaven, where Susie spend her time after the death and tracks this world where her family tried to overcome with their grief. Susie had the opportunity to observe how her dearth has affected to her family, murder and those who had been around her. On December 6, Susie takes a short-cut through the cornfield back from the junior high. She was trying to taste a snowflake when she saw Mr. Harvey. He invited her to look at the hole in the earth, which he built for the kids in the neighborhood. Those snowing winterâ€™s night little girl Susie was raped and murdered. After her death, Ray Singh became the first suspect, the first and only boy who loved Susie. Later he proved his alibi. Susie was trying to go to the duplex with her father and show him who the real murder was. Her father, Jack Salmon, who goes crazy with grief over the loss of his lovely daughter, began to suspect Mr. Hervey. But he has no proof. This is a cleverly constructed novel which can be separated into two parts. The first part is like mystery story where Susie was murdered and after that live in her heaven with Franny, a middle aged woman who becomes Susie and Holly's mentor, and a little girl Holly. The second part is mostly becomes pure story, where Susie continues to watch how lives her family and think about her murder, trying to understand why it happened. The book is written in a style accessible to the teenagers. The language is plain in the best tradition of story-telling but at the same time itâ€™s contain detective style. Seboldâ€™s descriptions of afterlife and relation between people who lost the most important treasure are beautifully observed."
Russian,"How would you spend a million... What's happiness? Surely, it depends. And still, there are some features common for everyone. For me happiness is freedom.

I am not alone as I asked all my friends and no one is willing to be loaded with such a burden as taking care of one million dollars/pounds/roubles etc.;D) I like being free, I like being the one who makes decisions what to take and what to deny and I like being quick and easy at gettting rid of money for the sake of those who are in need."

Russian,"Nosferatu Yesterday I saw a movie, directed by Vernor Herzog, it called ""Nosferatu"". The story tells us about young english gentleman who should go (how to say it more poetic about ""making the trip""/""going for adventorous trip""?) to Transilvania in case to make a deal with duke Dracul on real estate. On his way to Carpatian mountains he meets gypsies who warn him from this trip telling scaring legends about Dracula and his mysterious castle. But his not that type of man to be scared by these stories. He arrives to the castle and meets there dead-white duke (I mean, his face is very white) who treat him very well. But during the dinner Jonathan accidentally cuts his finger, in this very intense moment duke catchs his hand and sucks the blood. Actually this movie isn't scary, most of all it presents an interesting novel (script) with dramatic landscape and decorations of XIX century (I suppose so). Expressive acting and static picture remains of those black&white silent movies of early XX century. Also Isabel Adjani is stunning, though her acting consists of numerous sad looks to the horizont (I mean, she stands and looks with a sad glaze somewhere faraway)."
Russian,"My kitty! I want tell you about my cat. I and my wife love pets but we had not it in our home. Therefore we decided to took a kitty although I have an allergy on cats, mold and dust. Long time ago we looked on kinds of cats, and we stoped on abbesin cat. It is a short-haired cat and has a bright braun color hair. In addition the every hair has three colors so the color seems as iridescent. She is a female. She is two months and twelve days old. Her grandfather was a champion. In the first day we bought some milk and special kitty food. She mew loudly in the car when we transfered her to our house. You will not believe but she was happy when we came home. Moreover she has found a cat's toilet. She is a clever kitty. On the other hand she is bit silly. I can tell you about her character. It is very calm when she meets but very active when she plays. Today was the first day when she lives alone in the room. When I came from the work, she was sleeping. Furthermore the climat of our room became more favourable and claim."

Russian,"Early time for getting up. I'm such a night owl. But whole previous week I was working on my day regimen. I began to go to bed before midnight (not at 4 a.m. or 2 a.m. as usually). So in the end of the week I was able to wake up without alarm at 7 a.m. But then the daylight saving time happend. Gosh! I'm so envy with early risers. I wish I could remove my English study and another routines that connected to the computer from night time to the early morning time. Because in the mornings I limited with my time in front of computer by necessity to go to work. But in the evening sometimes it's too difficult to come off computer. I know how important to sleep. But it must be the most boring thing in the world. Actually I've written this post just to drop here two lines. I've subscribed to the on-line training ""Week of early time for getting up"" (sounds a bit like slogan for zombies))). And now I hope a lot that it be work out somehow and help me with my wish to get up early."

Russian,"taking exams hey. now that i've screwed up my first exam, i've been making up excuses for myself, which is actually not so bad after all ('you're a blundering idiot' would be an excuse fair enough, and would probably give me motivation, too), the problem is, the excuses i make are kind of... cheap. what i've been telling myself are things that are neither useful nor true, things like 'at least i am good-looking' and 'nice guys finish last', and... well, you get the idea. the problem is, pedagogical tricks do not really work with me. i wish they would, i really really really do, but hell, they don't. instead of getting angry and pissed off and working hard to succeed at the next exam, i am sitting at this cafe, smoking a cigarette lazily and making up irrelevant excuses. ans even that would be okay, if only there was something else, something i would be very, very good at, something i could be proud of, something that could, you know, compensate, make other things unimportant, make me go 'who cares about this pedagogy anyway' not in a trying-to-make-myself-believe-it kind of way but in a just-stating-the-truth kind of way. all i want is to be worthwhile, or do something that is worthwhile i'm no longer sure i'm in the right place after all, man i'm no longer sure there is a right place"
Russian,"Stephen Fry on Languages and BBC's Coming Documentary Series Part 1 I've decided to follow my friend's advice and do comprehension checks. This time I've chosen Stephen Fry's monologue. It turned out to be really long, but if you are interested in Stephen Fry or languages, please help me with it. I don't know anything about French, so I've typed the words intuitively, sorry. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2P6DcSyon4&feature=player_embedded Up to 06:20 We come to count toâ€¦ to talk about that amongst other things but it's the, it's the one that's going first of all in our projects. It's documentary series, a five part documentary series for the BBC and the rest of the world, naturally. And it's about language. Language and languages, everything to do with it, really, that we can cram into five hours. Obviously, you'll need fifty hours or five hundred hours to cover every extraordinary thing about this gift that all humans have, this thing that is part of being human like a passable thumb. It's one of the clear markers that make us distinct from other creatures on the earth as far as we can tell. It's about language. And language is the thing, the gift. It's what the French have a good distinction â€œlernen parol(?)â€. There's language that the structure, the thing that we all can do and there is this instance of it that I'm using now which happens to be in English. You know, it's like there is chess. Do you play chess? What do you think of chess? And there is a particular game of chess going on at any one moment. And so language, as I say, is common to the all mankind. And it is mysterious our origins, really, and so partly we'll be to try to understand how it grew in us, when it developed within our brains, was it the trigger that made us really the special species that we are. Which is a tautology special species, isn't it? Is it the counter of the ______ of our moving out of Tanzanian Canyon into the whole of the rest of the world? Did that happen at the same time as the origin? How did all languages divide in the way sense the races divide from Caucasian toâ€¦into Caucasian and so on. And then there are all kinds of issues of language. Languages can be used for almost anything. I'm using it now to transell(?) as the documentary series about language but it's also used to seduce, to flatter, to change people's minds, to whip people up, to cause _______ of hatred or love. And there is transgressive language, language of swearing and language of inappropriateness as we'd now call it in taboo words and so on. Swearing in our culture, we take it of course because it's so deep in our bones that we are shocked by certain words, but the mostly words that refer to parts of the human body that connected to excretion and copulation. There is nothing reasonable about that at all, it's completely mysterious. And if you were an alien and you were looking down at the planet, you would say â€œWhat are the things that this species does that the most shaming and appalling? What's about they torture children, they kill, they abuse?â€. So presumably words like torture and kill, and cruel would be the taboo words, because they refer to the disgusting things that humans do. The nice thing they do is, well, they make babies, they continue their species in acts of love and spasms of joys. So those would be really good words. __________the reverse. You can say â€œI was in the traffic, it was cruel, it was torture!â€ and nobody turns a hair and you refer into the worst things we do, but just say a word vaguely connected to the lavatory area and people go pink and say â€œHow you dare to talk like that?â€ It's so strange! There is no reason for that. It goes back to genesis in the Judaic Christian culture. It is the first point about genesis is the shame and shame at _____, shame at those parts of the body. Adam and Eve didn't said â€œOh, my God! We are naked, we must cover our noses.â€ or â€œWe must cover our knees.â€ They immediately went for the areas that will do with genital things. So it seems to be deep ____. It's not universal, I mean, even in Europe it isn't. It's actually quite hard to shock someone speaking Flemish Dutch by using parts of the body. It will be like shouting: â€œYou, nostril!â€ OK, I'm nostril. And say, if you call them anything to do with your privet areas. They'll go: â€œYeah, OKâ€. I mean they're sort of familiar with the fact that in our culture it's very rude. People have this idea that language degrades, that somehow it's less pure even within a lifetime. And that what young people say some is sloppy or it's not good, or that there is a proper style of language. I don't believe any of that; I think it's complete nonsense. I think one can speak elegantly and beautifully in almost any discourse you choose. But I think it's also the nature of English but other languages to, particularly English, because of its historical importance since really the 19th century when Britain's _______ all the way to Americans taking over that mental and the use of English as the international language of everything from aviation to the Internet, is that it is a mongrel language both in a philological sense in its origins of Saxon(?) and Frisian(?), and Judaic(?) languages and obviously the Romans languages Latin and Greek, but also within that it's a mongrel. Every time someone who speaks English, opens their mouth, whether they know it or not they tend to be repeating phrases from Milton and Shakespeare, and Chaucer but also from nautical and legal, and gangster, and criminal, and all kinds of discourses, all jostling together. It's a little like London. London is the city where you're on the same street you have the 17th century building next to a 13th century building next to a 21st century building and some people think that's impure. In France, for example, where a zone in Paris is incredibly protected within the parific(?) they have old grand proge(?), but generally speaking it's a museum and their language is the same, because they have academy France and they protect the language as they see that as the right thing for French. When English is much more organic and it changes and it's full of Americanisms, full of Australian isms and now full of all kinds of mixtures of that."

Russian,"my letter Hi Yana! I am grateful to you for the letter. I agree that is necessary to learn English. It took me a long time to write the answer. Sorry about that ïŒ If compared with you it takes me a long time to write a letter in English. Firstly, I try to write correctly. Secondly, I donâ€™t have enough time for it. In the letter you were interested in my hobby and interests. Yes, I really consider myself a very vigorous and active person. I like all new; a good company; and to active in life; to visit new places. But it doesnâ€™t mean that there is not enough romanticism in me. Like you I like to be alone, to set with my best girl-friend in a cosy cafÃ© and talk about something, for a long time, to walk in the evenings on the river bank, in the park or in other romantic places. I do love such moments in my life. And what about you? As for my hobbies, youâ€™ve probably guessed that I love art strongly. Especially dances!!! They help me to my energy to the necessary channel, to show myself off on the stage and to keep sit . This is my spirit!:) And I consider that dance quite well. What do you think of it? And still I like to sing for myself. I donâ€™t enjoy singing on the stage very much. These are my hobbies. I hope, it was interesting to you learn about me something new. Iâ€™m looking forward to you answer. Cheers! Aleksa."

Nevertheless, by 2000 the ratio of births amounted to exactly 10 millions.

Thai,"Nice Meditation Camp Have you ever heard about Dharma? Dharma is Buddha's doctrine which Buddishes use as a living principle. During 30th April-3rd May, I and my friends in the faculty of Medicine have an opportunity to go to a Dharma retreat named ""à¹à¸ªà¸‡à¸˜à¸£à¸£à¸¡à¸ªà¹ˆà¸­à¸‡à¸Šà¸µà¸§à¸´à¸•"" (Saeng Dham Song Chewit),at Parkchong district, Nakhonrachasrima province located in the north-eastern of Thailand. At first, I'm not interested or enthusiastic to go to that place. But when I arrived, the first thing which made me stunned was a very requisite environment. The landscape was very spectacular just like tourist attractions in the northern of Thailand, because the Dharma retreat was surrounded by a massif. The climate was so fine. A little cold wind blew over a meditation hall. It was cold even if it was a Summer in Thailand which everybody know that is very hot. Everything made me feel happy and serene. The first thing we had planed to do was having a lunch. We had a lunch with a happy mood, because the meal was very delicious. Cooks intended to cook every meal for people who intended to come here. Every meal was a vegetarian food that encouraged people not to encroach animals. Everyone enjoyed eating so much. Then, let me tell you about practicing. We woke up at 4.00am that was very early for all of us. The things we had to do were praying, do meditation and walking meditation. Walking meditation made us conscious and not negligent, especially while we were walking through the path, not only the walking path, but also the path of life. we had walked until the sun risen. After that, we went to listened to monks teaching about Dharma. The monks were able to explain the Dharma lessons to be easy to learn and understand. We liked to listen to the Dharma lessons, although we were just teenagers. Most of contents were about how to be a good human and a nice doctor. And most of them were suitable for all of us who would be a doctor in the future. I think that going to this Meditation Camp has given me a priceless experience and made me know how to lead the life happily and peacefully. I think if you guys have an opportunity to go there, you will have a happier life for sure."

Thai,"My Elementary Education First of all, this subject reminds me of the very croel thing,which is the passing of time that we,all mankind, have to face . The elementary school, that I went to, was I a Christian school called Pajasub School. It's located on Ratchadaphisek road in Bangkok. When I was in grade1, I was selected to be in the Christian's class for some mistake reason because I am Bhuddist. I had to sing and pray some kind of Christian stuff. I was the only bhuddist student in that class ,so I felt a little nervous at the beginning of the semester but everything is going just fine. I could adapt myself well. When I was an elementary student,I didn't pay attention in the education so much. I was just mocking around with my friends playing some kind of marble game at the playground. After I finished Grade2,the very important thing occured to me. I was nominated to be in the most cleverest student's class. And that changed my education a lot. I could say it changed my life as well. I was starting to pay more attention in the education since then and I had been in that top class 7 years in a row untill I finished the Junior High. After that I went to the most famous high school in Thailand, Triamudom Suksa School,which I could not maintain being in the top class anymore."

Thai,"What is your bad point? Right now, my German and Japanese skills are not as good as I expect because of a lack of use and practice. So, Iâ€™m now trying to brush up my knowledge by reading books and doing self-study about these languages. Or I should talk about something else, like... Iâ€™m a person who prefers to get everything perfectly done, and I sometimes find myself in trouble because of too much perfectionism. For example, when I was a sophomore, I spent too much time on doing assignment since I expected to be the best, so I couldnâ€™t meet the deadline.

Thai,"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? As the old adage goes, change is inevitable. It is often for better and cannot be done overnight, which means it could takes much effort. If there could be one thing that I need to change for my home town, I would want to change all corrupt practices and political unrest existing in my country at the present. In this essay, Iâ€™d like to give my reasons for above statements in following sentences. Firstly, corruption is part of Thai society for very long time and takes place at every level in government from front-office clerks to minister. For example, this can happen in a way that contracts of government projects can be bought by companies involved in bidding processes, which can be harmful for development of country. Yet, some groups of people even believe that corrupt government can be accepted as long as it can make them eat and sleep well through some corrupt governmentâ€™s populist policy. That can be very wrong idea because in reality there is no such country in the world that prospers by corruption. Therefore, I'd like to get rid ofÂ corruption for a good future in both economy and quality of life for the whole country."

On the other hand, it would be more other problems of Thai sociey. You all can share your ideas together."

Thai,Enneagram - The romantic The fourth is an idealistic people. He fills up his mind with ideal partner or perfect job. He lives with expectation that he will find his missing part of his life.

Thai,"Favourite sport Nowadays many people spend most of their time on work. I could say that they forgot something important like exercise and sport. Sport is an important thing because it can give you a better health. I strongly believe that the harder you exercise, the more calories youâ€™ll burn overall. Moreover, Women can get natural beauties without the use of diet pills and drugs. I love lots of sports, such as, baseball, cricket, motor racing and swimming. I like to swim but it is less fun than baseball. The one that I like most is baseball so my favorite sport is definitely Baseball. Baseball is a sport in which two teams meet for a period of 9 innings score points by hitting a leather ball with a large bat and then successfully making it around 3 bases and finishing by running over. The initial starting point. Baseball is a lot more than just hitting a ball and running around bases, and that is what makes it so much fun to play. Baseball requires strategy and physical fitness to succeed at it. It takes one who can play as a team person and look out for more than just himself. Baseball requires at least 9 players on the field at all times when on defense. There are 9 positions on the field. The last sport I want to talk about is Football. Ever since I was young my favorite sport to watch has been Football and I know many people also like football. In my opinion, football is the funniest sport to watch. In conclusion my most favorite sport is baseball and I also have swimming and Football as my second and third favorite sports."

Thai,"SUMMARY: The pernicious pinkification of little girls Antonia Senior, in her article â€œThe Pernicious pinkification of little girls,â€ explains the pinking process of girlhood which changes girlsâ€™ attitude to interest in beauty and fancy world rather than focusing on education and future career. Nowadays, every childâ€™s stuffs were categorized into two genders, for boys and for girls. Girlsâ€™ stuffs let little girls to value princesses as their role models. However, they donâ€™t admire the wise and brave princesses but the girlish, pretty, pinky, soft, and sweet princesses. Toys and clothes emphasize the importance of being feminine. This girly process is increasingly widespread. There are so many stuffs produced for girls only such as girlsâ€™ jeans with butterflies and hearts. The process is not about beautiful things only, but it affects girlsâ€™ attitude to learning. Even girls graduate from schools and enroll in colleges more than boys, boys still beat girls when it comes to spatial skills like maths and sciences. The gender-stereotyped idea makes boys and girls limit themselves to gender-specific subjects according to their own value. Besides, when women graduate, they leave the bright future in a good-positional job to marry men. These show the womenâ€™s attitude which is influenced by fairy tales when they are little girls. The gender-stereotyped idea settles on their mind. So all that women really concern about are looking good, being feminine, and ending up with a good guy. The girlsâ€™ view of the world comes out like this partly because of girly, princessy, fairy things that suggest them since they are little child. Therefore, the real cause of this pinking process is the way their parents guide them to be. Parents are the one who nurture their own girls by surrounding them with those girly stuffs that give them some attitude about how to live."

Thai,"Transportation in Bangkok Increased number of cars each day has a very significant impact on peopleâ€™s living in Bangkok. What will happen? If in the future we assume that everyone has a car. Compared to the past car buying is very simple today. Car sales company uses a variety of techniques to persuade customers to buy a car. With attractive promotions such as free first class insurance, pay by installments with 0% interest for first-three years included a lot of premium with one year warranty. It becomes obvious that everyone can have a car. Even though Bangkok now has Sky train Subway and BRT, bus rapid service, but the construction still not cover the ultimate areas and Cause the amount of car on the road increased continuously. Especially during the prime time traffic congestion in Bangkok gets even worse. In summary, I think the government should have the ability to formulate new policies with potential action. For example Campaign to have a car pool, take a serious with any person who ignored a traffic laws, specify that anybody driving a car is obliged by law to keep a driver license at all times and facilitate to use a public transportation by creating an alternative multiple channels such as public bus boat train sky train and subway with discount promotions.

Thai,"Thailand Thailand is located in the center of South East Asia. It is the world's 50th largest country, with an area as large as France. The capital and the most crowded city of Thailand is Bangkok. According to the latest survey of National Statistical Office, the number of Thai people is estimated at 65 million. In the old days, Thailand had a formal name called ""Siam"" but was changed to ""Thailand"" later in 1939. The word ""Thai"" is actually a name of an ethnic group from the central plain. It doesn't mean ""Freedom"" like it is generally believed. Even though Thailand's name is not involved with liberty, in an agelong history of Thailand, Thailand is the only South East Asian nation that has never been colonized from powerful western countries."

The younger should obey the older since seniority order is important for thai culture. But she didn't respect that order. Then the second event was happened. The older did dress for the younger girl. The younger girl was very annoyed and felt uncomfortable for that action. but she didn't response anything at that time. because it's public. The conflict with each other started going on. Everyday they response to each other by their unpleasant action. Girl fighting doesn't like guy fighting. They don't fight with fist. They fight with their face emotion. It's quite girly action. Like many dramas. It won't be stop easily. Finally, I wish no one can get hurt from girl fighting."

Thai,"do monthly personal expense record is very useful. I had never done monthly expense records over 2 weeks, because I often forgot what I bought and sometimes bored to record it on bookkeeping everyday. I though it was not important to do it. After I have done with a monthly account record, I felt good to see how money lefts each day. I saw what I buy in each day , and I could take the nonsense things away. In addition, I have got more money lefts at the end of month, and I deposited it in bank account . When I see the number in deposit passbook increase, I will happy so much. Anyways, there was an unbelievable. I sometimes spent not over 100 baht per day. I could do it about a half of month. Generally, I spent one hundred and something. I didnâ€™t know why I spent a lot even if I felt not like this. However, If I didnâ€™t do record, it would never happened. In my opinion, I think doing record is very useful . it makes me know how to manage money in my hand, teach me to be adult, and teach me to keep it up. Anyway, I will keep on doing it next month.

Thai,"Graduation day Today there was a graduation ceremony at my language school. :) I have been studying Japanese in this school since last April so it has been almost a year. Our school teaches 45 mins per class and there are 4 classes per day with 5mins break then 10 mins break and another 5 mins break in between. Some of my friends said that there is too little time to study but I think it was ok because if the class is too long I'll become sleepy anyway. There are 3 months in one term and after each term we'll have to take a replacement test. If we did good we could skip the next class and go on with more higher level. As a result, I have a new text book every three months ^^and also new teachers. All of the teachers I have studied with, everyone has their own style and their own teaching method which I'm kind of impressed. For example, Ateacher often tell stories other than in the book and always teaches new vocabularies, Bteacher could explain a complicated articles so that it seems easy, Cteacher is very enthusiastic well I don't know how she did but I've never felt drowsy in her class and so did others... and so on Talking about students, a lot of students come from China and Korea. The other students come from Thailand, Burma, Srilanga, Russia, and some European countries. Since today is a special day, I made some chocolate and brought it to school. My friends and teacher said it was delicious but what else could they say ? haha"

Thai,"My Brother's Birthday Hi there =) Today's my brother's birthday. Yes, he was born on Christmas Eve and turned 24 today. Fridays are my day off. I really love it as I don't have to go to school lol. So, my mom, my brother and I went to two temples, Wat Hualampong, à¸§à¸±à¸”à¸«à¸±à¸§à¸¥à¸³à¹‚à¸žà¸‡, and Wat Kunnatee, à¸§à¸±à¸”à¸à¸¸à¸™à¸™à¸—à¸µ, in the morning. Wat Hualampong is located on Pra-Ram 4 road. You can take the subway and get off at Sam Yan, à¸ªà¸²à¸¡à¸¢à¹ˆà¸²à¸™, station. Likewise, you can go to Wat Kunnatee by the subway, Huaikwang station. Wat Kunnatee is very close to my home. I also made a coffin donation at Wat Hualampong. It's a Thai tradition that Thais always go to a temple on their birthdays. We pray and make a wish for something good to happen in our life. =) After that, my mom and I went to Platinum, a shopping mall that sells clothes in whole sell price. We just took a wander for 1 hour and went back home. Before arriving home, we decided to stop at a shopping plaza on Sutthisan Road, which is near our home, to have lunch and to buy some stuff. Eventually, I bought a handbag. =) Oh, we also bought a little piece of cake for my brother lol =)"
Thai,"What do you want? Last week during my Japanese class I was asked the question I found hard to answer. The lesson was about verb ""to want"" and the question was simple. ""What do you want?"" (ä½•ãŒæ¬²ã—ã„ã§ã™ã‹) Sensei gave us samples of vocabularies we could used. Cars, Money, Food, The basic words we learned in previous lessons about basic daily used words. It was then I realized I have all those ,All basic needs plus some unnecessary things. So what do I want? I gave her the answer composed of basic words and basic grammar. Still, now, I do not know what I want."

Since a long time, Thai people and a lot of tourists always enjoy Songkran day in Thailand between 13rd-15th April every year. In Songkran day we always splash the water to each other without blaming. Everyone may not know each other, but they can enjoy the Songkran's recreation together and fulfilled with happiness.

Thai,"First Entry Hi, everybody. I am a newbie here. I know of Lang-8 from Ask. antimoon. comâ€”a Q&A site for language learners. I am very excited to know that there is a site like this. It's like a dream come true for me (and I am not exaggerating!). I have always wished that I could improve my English skills by writing journal entries and having someone correct them for me. I used to think that, if I had a lot of money, I would pay a native speaker teacher to correct my writing. Now I don't need to have that much money anymore because Lang-8 is free. Well, not exactly free, because I am obliged to check other people's journal entries written in Thaiâ€”my native languageâ€”as well. Right now I know so little about Lang-8. I haven't read the help section yet. In fact, currently I don't have much time. I am trying to get a scholarship to study abroad, so most of my time should be spent on preparing for the exam I'll be taking in another 12 days. It's only a slim chance because I haven't begun studying for it yet. But I'm going to do my best. Writing this entry takes me quite a long time. Maybe I shouldn't be doing this now, considering how little time I have left before the test. But I can't help it. When I knew of this site last night I felt so excited that I must experiment with it today. It will be quite some time before I write another entry. Feel free to correct any mistakes you spot. Feel free to comment."

Thai,"This is The First Day I Join Lang-8 I heard that it's very beneficial to improve my writing skill. Lately, I've finished English class in my University. Our class is really boring. My teacher normally came late about 15-30minutes. He's always making an excuse that this was because of traffic jam but he never said that this's because he had played games all of the night. He's always talking about his hobbies, showing us his photos, talking about what joy that you uses when you play games but he rarely talked about our lessons. I don't want to compare him to my previous english teacher Adelina who had gone to Dubi. He's different league with her. Thank you for tolerating to listen to my boring story."
Thai,"The Elite Subordinate First of all, I work for the Royal Thai Navy and my post is on the mine hunting ship named Tha Din Daeng. I was graduated 4 years ago, it was not a long time but long enough for me to discover something,significant by observing the behaviors of my subordinates. From the observation, there is a similarity in the group of persons, who seem to be not pay attention in their work and prefer joking around and laugh loudly while others were working. I found that the operational capability of this kind of persons tend to be far more higher than the regular ones. At the first time, I was not so sure about this notice because there was an exception in one person, who works regularly but has the highest operational capabity in the ship, he can fix almost every mechanical failures which occurs during the operation. I thought it might be a coincident and try not to jump to the conclusion. Later on, I was informed that the highest capability man used to be a misbehaviour too, a long time ago. That information assures my notice. However, it was just a notice and I didn't run any experiment to support ,so it might just be corresponding only in my ship. The experiment needed to be run to find out whether or not this theory is true."

Thai,"English Correction English is an imporant language in Thai university. The univeristy try to push students to communicate and use a lot of English for studying. We though that recently advance knowledge can transfer faster with English language. This might be a problem for Thai students in the future. We might encounter the problem about Anglish (Asian English, my vocab) accent like Singlish. Thai listening skill is poorer than reading skill. Since we have many textbooks available in English but a few English native speakers to communicate with. Thai student often speak with wrong pronucation but Thai people can understand Thai English or Asian English pronunciation easier from circumstance. Writing skill is the worst skill for Thai student. Since we don't have anyone to correct grammatic sentence and tell how different between right and wrong grammar. Grammar is the hardest part for writing an essay. Many students need the native speaker to correct their English in university life, even the reader is Thai viewer. How hard of this! Thank you for everyone who help me to correct my English. I wish one day I will write and speak fluently in English not Anglish."
Thai,"Family and career Family is the small unit of society. Everyone has their own family, it could be simply one like husband and wife, parent and son, or even expanded family like grandparent, father, mother and children. People said that good society should start from good family that take care of their own responsibilities. Thai family has strong relationship between cousin, uncle, aunt, niece and nephew. This reason might be we have agricultural structure. We have to plant rice field together, live in one large homeland from parent. The situation and life make us more relationship with our relatives. Career is one goal for life. People would like to have their own careers which they can earn money and dignity. Once we have civilization city, people go to seeking better salary and high payment in capital city. Now career make us leave our own hometown and family. The intelligent child left home to study in a capital school since they were a teenager. This lead them to keep continue their career in big city like Bangkok. Some people decided to achieve their life by going back home then start the new life near their family, this make them feel warm in heart when they need any support and the family provide a big hand. Family and career are two things in our life that everyone has to balance with. It will complicate when people change their status to marriage, widow, or devorce. Someone has a good idea that people who success in career and life because they start family first so they can focus on their career. It meant that they firstly married in young age and build up a family, during the first couple year they have a baby. While the wife has to take care baby during husband is responsible for main financial support. The man can work hard at the beginning life, if it progress well they get promotion in the firm or the business. Afterthat they should reschedule time for mentoring to his employee or even their child. This seems a good suggestion for life. The good reason is that when you success in your career, at least you have someone share your happiness and smile to you when you get back from work."

Thai,"Horizon is in front of me I have been studying English a year and a half ago. Now I'm quite far from the starting point but still very far away from expert. Every times I'm look back, I'm feel great, bigger than before and not a dumb anymore Even though I still can't use it fluently, at least seeing the target make you have more power. I'm always glad when I think that ""If I have not been doing it since that day, today I must still be a lousy guy for sure. I'm feel big when compare myself to the others, especially my friends at the same age. For me, English language is the very powerful device. I can read many good books (even if now I can just read a few books, my feat isn't enough yet) , reach a lot of great website , get more fun when watch some movie , make friends with foreigners (Now I have some from Burmese, Japan and America, all from lang-8) or even get a better salary. It's like a door of freedom. In the future, more or less I think it must be a money magnet for me. To day I always try to engulf the big bunch of vocab then a few months later, found it dissipate from my head lol. But the most terrible thing is Grammar, especially Tense always sicken me. I think the ones who learn Thai or the another must feel the same. I think Thai Grammar must be tougher than English, fortunately I understand it. Looking forward to hear you comment about learning language or something and thanks in advance for correction. Any advice from any nation is welcome. You also can meet me on Facebook by search mumagagi@hotmail. com . Thank you very much indeed."
Thai,"Essay about online learning I was going to enroll an online academic writing course. So, I was supposed to submit them a diagnostic essay to see if i am capable for the class, which is a bit advanced. However, I have decided to take TOEFL writing course instead since I have planned on taking a TOEFL and wanted to improve my English writing in general such as grammartical syntex and basic writing organization, not a critical thinking which is taught in an academic writing class (I might take it when I finish this class). Here is the essay. It could be boring but that is why we call it academic, I presume? Anyway, This is my masterpiece so far because I had not ever finished any essay I wrote in english :( PROMPTS:Â Please write a short passage, about 300 words, telling me what you think about online learning. Have you taken an online course before? What do you think about online courses in general? What do you think are the benefits of taking an online course? What are the disadvantages? Any other thoughts on this topic? Â I have never taken an online course before but I am interested to take one. Since I have had to focus on my family, taking an online course seems to be a best idea to achieve knowledge because it provides flexibility and convenience. These are, in my opinion, some benefits of online learning. First, there is no necessary toÂ physically attend classrooms. Online courses are very suitable for people who are uncomfortable to travel due to their locations or their personal physical problems and so on. It saves time and sometimes it saves money. Students can get on their computers at any hour on any day at home and do not need to pay for travel to a class. Second, Online courses are self-paced with flexible schedules. Students can catch up class work any time and it can be scheduled around work and family. Third, Online courses are more privacy. There is no distraction for people who always feel intimidated or shy when place in traditional classroom. As a result, those people would feel more confident and can be learnt more effectively. In a contrary way, there are disadvantages of taking an online course, too. As I mentioned that online courses are self-paced, it could be very easy for student to neglect course assignments. Moreover, without being in instructorsâ€™ sight, it also could be very easy for student to cheat; to copy answers, to have someone else do their assignments. With cheating, students are never able to know their true potentials and they would not be able to properly improve their skills. Online learning is portable and flexible but it is not for everyone. With being independent, Students can easily get distracted. Therefore, online learners have to remain motivated and stay on task to prevent themselves falling behind."

Thai,"Animal testing Animal testing is used for helping people and animals from disease. There are three main areas of research, that is Basic or pure research, drug testing and cosmetic testing. The scientist has studied about the good medical advances from animals. However, people are against. There are some misunderstand about animal testing. First, they believe that dogs, cats, and monkey are mainly use in research. In fact, scientist mostly uses rats and mice which is born and raised for research. Second, they believe that the more expand biomedical research, the more animals are used. It is just only 10 percent of research includes with animals. They offer the alternatives include â€œlab-grown cells and organs ,and human clinical tests.â€ Instead of using animals. On the other hand, there are supporters of animal testing have some good arguments. First, they think that itâ€™d be unethical to induce humans to the same test and release drugs to the publics without knowing the possible side effect of drugs. Another one is there is no choice to animal due to their similarity to human. Some organization argue for the three Râ€™s in animal testing ; Replace, Reduce and Refine. Anyways, animal testing can save many human lives and will make the world a better place."

Thai,"Tsunami Tsunami is a series of waves caused by underwater earthquakes. The word ""Tsunami"" is a Japanese word meaning ""harbor wave."" Tsunami is a series of huge waves. It can move for long periods as much as several hundreds or thousands of kilometers wherever it caused and is also very powerful. When Tsunami comes close to shore, it will produce higher waves which are usually called giant waves. The waves flood along the shore, devastating everything including buildings, lives, and properties. Tsunami striking Thailand on 26 December 2004 was the first one, causing approximately 5400 deaths, 8500 casualties, and 2900 missing persons in six Andaman Sea coastal provinces. It was the worst natural disaster to ever strike Thailand."

Thai,"Being freshman Being freshman is more difficult than being high school student. For instance freshman has many activities more than high school student such as Freshy Game, meeting association, etc. So that freshman has to do it together with manage their time to read books or do homeworks. Some freshmen can't handle it that make they have poor grade. Freshman takes less subjects than high school student but every subject is very difficult and also has a lot of homeworks or reports. Many freshman have to go to bed late almost every day for read many books, prepare for next lesson, do the research, etc. So you can see their faces are full of pimples. Apart from their hard study, some of them have problem with adjustment to new friends, separate from old school friends and don't have any new friends yet or not intimate as old school friends. These absolutely make them feel lonely or don't want to go to the university. All in all I think, however, to be freshman is not easy. If you are freshman that mean you are one step to be adult and you should proud of it."

Spanish,"Confused Next year I will be graduating from the university. Altough I'm happy, I'm also very concerned because the school districts are not hiring at all. Bilingual teachers are not necessary here in Laredo. Why? because since it's a border (US-Mex) everybody speaks and understands the 2 languages (Engl-Span, not everyone is fully bilingual but some degree of bilingualism exists). So, I don't know, our teachers told us that we must try to look for a job out of town, or become substitute teachers until we find a job,that's so wrong, I meant what kind of encouragement is that? I don't know I will probably move out of town, but I don't know..."

Spanish,"Thresholds On the other hand, the Thresholds theory sums up the relationship between bilingualism and cognition. This theory is represented by the illustration of a house with three floors. The bottom floor represents the group of individuals whose current in both languages proficiency is below their average age level. This can bring negative outcomes because children wonâ€™t be able to function academically, plus negative cognitive effects may occur. The second floor describes the group of individuals with average age level proficiency in one of the languages. This stage of bilingualism allows children to function academically in one of the languages. However, no cognitive advantages may be observed during this stage. Moreover, the third floor portrays the group of â€œbalanced bilingualsâ€. This group is able to function at the average age level in both languages. Also, cognitive advantages superior than monolingual children may be observed."

Spanish,"What did I use to look like in the past? and What do I look like presently? REPORT OF OPINION-COLUMNIST 4th September 2010 What did I use to look like in the past? and What do I look like presently? For different reasons human being nowadays tries answering both questions to itself in order to look for either a better picture or image of itself to cope with a feeling of non-satisfaction and unhappyness that I think human being has always been involved with, especially during the present, in which everyone has to be slim, tall, nice, smart and handsome for a very competitive world not only for being a skillful professional in your career, but looking like very beautiful and handsome and attractive to others. We could likely answer that we used to look like uglier, and less smart and handsome than now, and probably with longer hair, and definitely less intelligent and experienced in life; but of course, we would always like and expect of ourselves to look like more beautiful and brilliant in any aspect of our lives. It is supposed and it has been part of our lives that evolution works very deep inside of us and as the time goes by, we strongly live many different experiences that help us to be like the way of being we are and look like the appearance we do, throughout the different social events and trends, and we would have ever probably thought to be going through those thoughts and way of seeing life which is part of the moment, the year and the Century we are in. So the best conclusion we can get on this report about what we look like now and what we had ever wanted to look like if we would have ever been asked for the next future, in the past is that we had better answer, the person should care about many important things other than the appearance we used to have in the past, and the one we have nowadays, because it is just a matter of an overall of events we are living in, and the result (overcome) of an evolution in our lives, and the most important thing is taking into account â€œthe personâ€ we are which is supposed to be our wealth, and letÂ´s be authentic and non-superficial, Shall we?

Spanish,"Continue studying Korean on Vacations. Today I decided to continue studying Korean. Lately, I have been studying it at all and without knowing in advance I had an interview last Saturday and it seemed like I didn't know anything of Korean, or like I completely forgot how to speak it. The interview was with a Korean Channel or something, I really didn't know because it was our Closing Event at our Korean Institute and I was so focused on correctly performing a Taekwondo dance with my group that day, but then my teacher came and told me to do that interview. I think I was nervous or I didn't understand what the interviewer wanted me to say. I introduced myself, not speaking correctly in some parts, and I noticed it, but they told me it was too long and I only needed to say something like ''I'm studying Korean and I like the Korean culture, I also like to listening to Korean music and practice Taekwondo''. It was really easy but I don't like the Korean music and I don't practice Taekwondo so it was like I was lying and I didn't like that. Avoiding this bad experience I had, I wanna share with you some nice moments I spent with my group at that event and after wards. I'm just waiting for the pictures so I can share them with you.

Spanish,"ANIME in my LIFE There are many things I like to do, but one particular hobby and sometimes part time job of mine is to draw, I remember drawing since I was four years old, I was a fan of a show called G Force or Gatchaman in Japan, thatÂ´s the first anime show I can remember ever watching, then when I was six or seven IÂ´d watch Iron 28 (Tetsujin 28) I loved that show, Then came along Saint Seiya, and every kid would watch that, it was a phenomenon but the actual figurines/toys were very expensive so I only had a few (I was particularly fond of Greek mythology since my grandad used to tell me the stories). Man I was so god damn addicted to Saint Seiya!!!, then a friend of mine was watching a show called Dragon Ball, and I hadnÂ´t payed attention to it because it was the story of a kid and I was already watching epic battles in Saint Seiya, nevertheless Dragon Ball got us all hooked as the kung fu tournaments began to take place in the series and soon enough we all began to forget about Â¨EL METEORO DE LA ESTRELLA DE PEGASOÂ¨!!!... sigh now that I look back at saint seiya, it was such a repetitive show haha theyÂ´d always use the same rutines and story arch formulas. So yeah, by the time Dragon Ball Z began to air in Mexico it was already 1997, and I was in Junior High, everybody watched the show, like every kid, otaku kid or not we would watch the show, many even recorded it, I remember my TV broke and I couldnt use the one in the living room, and I had to hit it to make it work haha poor tv. So thats when I was drawing all the time, I was one of the kids who were famous for his drawings skills, and we werent that many, maybe five kids in the whole school could copy like I could, at least 5 kids my age... and yes we would only copy... kinda lame I think. A couple years later a Â¨drawingsÂ¨ rival friend I had, lost my copied drawings I was so proud of (they were many, like 40 drawings) or so he said, and I thought IÂ´m never copying again and ever since IÂ´ve only drawn my own characters, well I guess we all copy to a certain degree, thereÂ´s no such thing as originality, after all we are all composite human beings. So well, I kinda became an Otaku in high school, I mean Id watch anime that wasnt necesarily being aired on standard TV like Evangelion and Rurouni Kenshin which became two of my all time favourite shows. At that time I was already writing a lot too and a few friends and I would get toghether to make up stories and characters, it was fun. To be honest I never really got along very well with other otakus, I was more of an artist than a fan, I never actually admired other artists since I always thought I could do what they were doing, but even better do it my own way, I think other otakus saw that as arrogance, but those were my honest feelings and I wasnÂ´t being a prick to anybody... I still feel the same way, itÂ´s like music, IÂ´ve never been able to say, this or that artist is the best I identify myself with him/her the most, iÂ´ve never been able to do that, thereÂ´s always something I like and something I donÂ´t. So yeah, hereÂ´s another page for my journal, I have also read some mangas, but mostly for research, since manga is not realy popular or mainstream in Mexico. IÂ´m sure its got many mistakes :P IÂ´m throwing a few manga pages IÂ´ve done for the record."

Spanish,"South Africa and GM The relationship between ethics and business has been difficult since their beginnings. Thanks to Plato, we can read about heated debates about this subject that took place more than 2.000 years ago. In spite all of this, we can say that there is no clear answer about how much of ethics a business should have. To some, a business is just a commercial endeavor that should try it maximize its profits whit in the legal framework. On the other hand, a business enterprise can be seen as a integral participant of society. Not excluded from the responsibilities that every citizen has. Now days, this concept is called Corporate Social Responsibility. It not only defines the domain of the business responsibilities towards the society, but also pursue an expanded stakeholders concept. A concept that indicates that the stakeholders of a business are not only their owners and customers, but also the whole society where it operates. If we consider a business with in this framework, it becomes much easier to understand the why GM stopped itâ€™s operations in South Africa more than 20 Years ago. The case about GM leaving South Africa cannot be analyzed as a isolated case1. It came after series of strikes, international sanctions and other companies decision to leave the country. This gives us a better idea to understand the reason behind it and later return to the country. Certainly, no company wants to leave a market that they are already established in. Moreover, a manufacturing company like GM, would find particularly difficult to take such a decision. The size of their operations and the time required to recover their investment makes the case for the company to stay. Given this situation, how does GM ends up leaving the country, is an interesting case to analyze the extended stakeholders concept previously talked about. In this case, the stakeholders were not only the african society, but the whole international community. The repudiation that generated the deeply disturbing nature of the apartheid, extended to the business domain as well. Forcing some to leave the country to avoid damage to their reputation, something that would affect negatively their international operations. At that time, GM, along other companies, had to balance their profit seeking nature with their responsibility to the society. However, this decision can be seen also as money-oriented, given the fact that they could lose business in the already desegregated United States. Anyhow, the fact that the society also demand to the corporations to act responsibly, is definitely a positive thing. However, we cannot forget about the consequences of this decision to the south africans, white and blacks. Even though it can be seen as positive to pressure the government of south africa at that time with this kind of measures, it is undeniable the economic effect that it creates in the country. With this kind of decisions, the most affected are the South Africans. Employment is lost, investment stops and the supply of goods diminishes. Given this situation, to which society should corporations owe their responsibilities? The local or the global stakeholders? Certainly, this can be a very difficult aspect to decide upon, as there are not clear answers. We can see how negative are the prospects for the new local company, Delta Motor Corporation. In fact, the company did not perform as expected, limiting itself to the local market and not exploiting the potentially lucrative exports market."
Spanish,"BirthdayÂ´s party Yesterday I had the birthday Â´s party of my smaller daughter. I was thinking about how different it was with mine.

Well really not earn I want say steal money. I said this because in every event that they make here we lose money, like in the Americanâ€™s cup, all that they said was that the competition bring money to the city but really they only spend money and finally the balance is always negative for the citizens that pay those events whit our taxes.

In August neither my parents or friends cantake vacations, so the only option I have it's stay in my bored village. However, this summer I am planning go abroad for an English course.

Spanish,"Hello everyone!~â™¥ My name is Sol Segatorriâ™¥ But you can call me 'Solbii' :D I'm a 14 years old girl from Argentina.

I've always been just 'good' in English, but two years ago I started reading a lot, not books, actually, but fanfictions >w<' it sounds weird, but yeah, I learned a lot from reading, and then I started to learn a lot with music and movies, and now I know a lot more English than the English level at my school (though my english teacher is kinda bitchy and it's kinda hard even for the ones that know a lot of English :/) Yesterday, I wrote a short entry in Japanese. I've been 'learning' (if it can called 'to learn') Japanese, since july 2009, but I'm really lazy, something I actually hate, so I just know a few words, some sentences, and my grammar is really, really poor. I planned attending to Japanese classes, but they seem to expensive for my mom to pay T__T so, I think that I can't go, and I have to study by myself. I've found a lot of resources on Internet to learn Japanese, but I think that so far the hardest thing to learn from Japanese is remembering all the on'yomi and kun'yomi readings of the kanjis, and all their meanings T__T they're a lot, though I have a good memory, I have to actually STUDY and LEARN them, not memorize them.. so, i'm in a big trouble >.<' I really like this website, it's really, really cool. I want to congratule whoever created it, it's really useful. And I'm glad I found it ^^ Plus, everyone is always so nice! ^^ I'll try to correct some Spanish blog posts later, too! I really wanna help everyone with their studying ^^ (the ironic thing here is that, I have an F on Spanish at school >.< and it is my native language, so stupid!)

Spanish,"Fireflies It is said that there are over 2000 especies of fireflies around the world, but only some of them fly. There are also a few remaining places qere we can still see how these little bees dance in the summer nights, like the ones that exist in some part of Japan. Although I've never seen real firelies, I really like the kind of feeling they inspire me. For me they are like metaphores of little lights of hope in the darkest night of desolation. Seeing little lights dancing in a dark night among trees and water must be the most beautiful thing^^. I hope they do not dissapear before I meet them. ^^"

Spanish,"Internet versus television All the things are changing faster and faster nowadays, and one of the most important is the way we communicate with the world and get information, something traditionally done trough the TV. Although the TV is still important, certainly people, and especially the new generations, are moving from the TV to the net as their primary way of communicate with each other, read the news or see their favourites movies or television programmes. I think that this is a real revolution and very positive on the whole. The things that you can do surfing the net are immense and really huge in comparison with the TV. I would say that the Internet represents the real freedom, because it is the only media that is not tightly controlled and subject to the censorship as it is the TV or the radio. In the net you can choose from an enormous selection the paper that you want to read, the field that you want to study, etc, and most importantly: you are who is choosing, and not being chosed as you are with the tv. It is true that the TV has a lot of channels and you can choose and switch from one to another, depending on your political tastes and preferences, but the range is very little actually compared with the Internet. Finally i would highlight the dangers that the Internet is facing at present. For sure the most important is the governs worldwide trying to repress the freedom of the net with more or less credible excuses depending on the country, promulgating laws whose real intention is to censorship the webs that are not agreeing with the so called ""political correctness"". I hope that the freedom of the net will continue for ever, but i am not very optimistic, knowing that Power doesn't like freedom at all."

Spanish,"About earthquakes Yesterday, there was a temblor in South Spain. There were deaths, that's sad. Recently earthquakes has caused damages worldwide. It all makes me think that the end of our age it's near. Mexico is a country located in a seismic zone. The most devastating earthquake was in 1985 (8.1 Richter), with about 10,000 deads. The Government hid information because they didn't want that people realized the magnitude of the event. The Government also did it because they were the culprits of a lot of deads caused by the bad planning of buildings. This year, I have lived three or four seisms- I can't rememeber how many, my head is full. They were of high magnitude, between 5.5 and 7 in Richter Scale. I am worried, probably there will be a great earthquake in Mexico which will destroy the city (Mexico City). The city is built over a lake system, buildings won't resist."

It was breathtaking to see how soldiers defuse bombs! The mood and the feeling of the film are impressive, so it looked like real war. Most people love movies like ""Avatar"", which I don't like very much. I hardly ever see movies like this. I remember being told about this film but I didn't pay attention to it.

Spanish,"Third post on Lang-8 Hi, It's poorenglish_ again, and this is my third post on Lang-8. I would like to write about my little experience with language courses. I began with Pimsleur, an audio-course, the mechanic is easy, listen, repeat and say some sentences. Ok, I think this method is good for beginners, you can get an understandable pronunciation, and some basic knowlegde if you want to travel soon to the country. Apart from that I don't see other benefits. Maybe it's because I'm not a patient person and I usually listen English, but I got bored very soon. I finished pimsleur in about sixty days (yes, I don't like to repeat lessons) My next course has been Assimil and I liked it.

Spanish,"what i like about him I'ts nor very original, is it? Girl meets boy, boy meets girl. But, hey I'm talikng about me right now, so taht means strange girl meets strange boy in very weird circumstances. Currently, the cold and naked truth Is that I can't no anything. He is in London, I am in my home town. But I dont want to talk about it, I want to talk about why I think it's a good idea to try to know him better, to try to break all my psochologial barriers and to find a reason to be alive outside of myself. The first, and the most important thing is that he is not the kind of man that I can manipulate. Being honest, sometimes I can be a awful and cruel bitch, and I know he won't cede to my dirty emotional blackmail or my not less dirty guilt trip. So, I' m happy cause I think I' ve finally found someone who can see my real face, which includes my dark side, and, at the same time, I am worryed because I am really used to manipulate people's emotions instead of say ""i'm sorry"" when I am wrong, and I think it's gonna be hard to give up with it. Although, i really believe a person like him can make me be a better girl. The second thing I like about him is that he knows about what I am talking about when I talk about pain. His life hasn't been very funny, really. He is able to understand me when I talk about my broken family, my fears and my contradiction, cause he has lived all that. He know what yo feel when you love and hate at the same time, when you are surrounded by people but you feel totally alone. For me, this is important. I dont want a relationship with the happiest person in the world, I just want someone who can understand my fears, my contradictions and my madness. And maybe cure it. The last thing is that I like his turned-up nose and his tattoos. No, I'm serious now, I find him cute. It's strange, because I've passed almost my whole life obsessed with guys who seemed to be Kurt Cobain's brothers: skinny, blondes and with a hippie style. And he is not blonde, he has not long hair, he is not anorexic and he is more a punk than a hippie."

Are you from another country? I asked her. Yes, I'm from Taiwan, she said. I was surprised, I never imagined that she was from another country. We had met a few months ago and she never mentioned it. At first I did not believe her, because she spoke my language perfectly, even with the local accent where i live. Then she told me she came when she was ten, but I still did not believe her until she started to speak in chinese as proof that she was a foreigner. After a while we stopped seeing each other but I still remember her. Today I was thinking about her, I hope to see her again someday."

Spanish,"ASCII Code for spanish characters. Hi, everybody: One of my lang-8 friends asked me how can he write the ""Â¡"" symbol with an English keyboard. I've already answered him in a private message, but I'd want to extend that reply for every lang-8 people. Maybe, somebody will find it as a help. If you have a non-Spanish keyboard, you can write the Spanish characters using the ASCII code. You must keep pressed the 'ALT Gr' key while you type the numerical code. Following are the most used Spanish characters and their corresponding codes: Ã¡ = ALT + 160 Ã© = ALT + 130 Ã­ = ALT + 161 Ã³ = ALT + 162 Ãº = ALT + 163 Ã± = ALT + 164 Ã‘ = ALT + 165 Ã¼ = ALT + 129 Ãœ = ALT + 154 Â¿ = ALT + 168 Â¡ = ALT + 173 I hope it would be of great help.

Spanish,"A short paragraph Please I need help with these paragraphs o. O They are about an article wich title was ""Forest Primeval"", well, is the part of ""Personal Opinion"" In my opinion, it was a very interesting and unique discovery, because fossils are important for us to identify new details about ancient plants and animals. A complete forest preserved in time is something that could transform our vision of that period, and it permits investigators to know what caused the decrease of some of those species. I couldnâ€™t agree more with the paleobotanic that believes we have a big opportunity to know how carbon dioxide affected the 300 million years ago atmosphere. Iâ€™m for investigations, but people that go there also have to be careful, they need to use correct protection."
Spanish,"Top Gear My culture has been deeply ""offended"" by the one of the hosts who laughed and pointed same of our flaws ironically. Everyone's making a big deal out of it. I honestly believe that this happens all the time, people make racist jokes all the time, but when the jokes or whatever is said is about one's culture it's just like they have offended our national pride. It has been commented in about every single news show I've seen today and I don't think it calls for it. Personally, I found way more offensive the activity in Australia's Big Brother in which they had to throw balloons to the Mexican flag, although this one also had some comments that were totally uncalled for. And to be honest, no one even knew about that Mexican sport car here. Guess it's gonna sell a lot after this. It's also a nice way to have something other than dead people on the news once in a while. Like we say, if the coat fits, wear it. I think those offended fit in the description made in the program... I don't find any other reason to be angry. For those interested here's a link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40jzd80ykf0 Couldn't find one without Spanish subtitles, sorry!"

I had been told that I was going to see a great number of animals in their habitat, including walrus, seals, penguins and whales.

However, there are a couple of places that have recently aroused my interest: New York and San Francisco. I have never felt any particular desire to visit the USA more than any other country, but last year I helped a friend (who is an English teacher here in Spain) preparing a project for high school students about USA cities. So I read a lot of things about approximately 10 cities. And among them, I discovered a lot of interesting things about those two. I also use to listen to a podcast of a man who lives in San Francisco and, of course, he talks a lot about the city. Who knows? Maybe next year I'll get to travel to the USA."

Spanish,"Innovative programs I have created and implemented innovative options in my classroom by differentiated instruction. For this, I usually plan my classes thinking of the main ideas that all students should be able to learn. However, the more detailed information that accelerated students may need depends on each individual. My lessons are planned around learning styles and multiple intelligences. Therefore, I plan a variety of activities such as games, music, dance, TPR, journals, pictures, puzzles, drawing, role playing, storytelling, individual work, small or big groups, etc. Another innovative way is the use of up-to-date technology. I constantly use PowerPoint, video and music. I find different internet services very educational. For example, students can demonstrate understanding of a variety of topics through online games, activities and simulations. They can improve their reading or listening skills by using fun websites such as Voki, which allows student to create avatars and use text-to-speech functions. We can also access a verity of authentic material from newsgroups, blogs, websites, etc. Besides, technology facilitates the assessment of students by using video or audio for speaking assessments."

Spanish,"Stephen King The last week, I started reading a Stephen King's novel, The Green Mile. It isn't the first novel that I've read of this autor, the last one was about 5 years ago. My girlfriend say that he isn't a god writer, but I'm completely desagree with her. If you read any of his books you feel all the scale of emotions that the caracters feel. You can't stop reading, and you finish the books in a few days, even when they are very large. Other aspect that I want to say is the enermous capacity of telling all type of stories, from terror to ordinary tales. If you look for in his bibliography, you can find stories that film director have put into scene: from the beatiful story about the friendship of a group of children in The Body, terror tales as The Shinning, Chrytine, or Carrie, and penitenciary scripts as The Green Mile or Rita Hayworth and Shawsank redemption. The last one with an amazing interpretation of the main actors. I think Stephen King have an impresive talent, and amazing imagination and I hope that he'll live for a lot of years to finnish The Tower book serie, he'll need it."

Eisa is a traditional okinawan dance with drums. You can find the whole greeting here http://lang-8.com/6250/journals/464813/Greeting-B but since it's a bit long I am dividing it in 2 parts, this is the second half Thank you. >> Since I came to Tokyo, my love for my hometown translated into a desire to contribute to broaden the influence of Okinawa's traditional arts through Japan's capital city. When I was still undecided on how to face this new challenge, I went back to Naha (Okinawa Prefecture's Capital) and assisted to the ""Naha Ozunahiki Hatagashira Gyoretsu Festival"", an event I attend every year since I was a child. There, I encounter myself with a contemporary eisa group, and I can still remember the goosebumps caused by their performance. That is how I found what I was looking for, and the impact of that moment still remains lively in my memory. Without forgetting that emotion, and as Honorific Ambassador of Okinawa I try my best to contribute in promoting Okinawa, from Tokyo to the rest of the Japan, and even further, to the whole world. I sincerely hope you will continue to support us for a long time."

I think that greek literature is amazing, as they invented literature, and it is very important in order to understand the subsequent literature. It is an universally truth that many cultures and literatures take something from Homer or Hesiod and all. After reading Aeschylus, I will go on with Sophocles."

Spanish,"Another, Other, Others, the Other and the Others I decided to do a whole entry dedicated only to these difficult words. It has just been frustrating that always I use them in a sentence, I get many corrections. The other day my mom said to me, â€œI have bought some caps. One of them is red, another is green, another is yellow, and the other is purple. Which one do you prefer?â€ I said, â€œNone of those colors is one of my favorite, can you buy me another (one)?â€ â”€Can I use both â€œanotherâ€ or â€œanother oneâ€ in that last question with the same meaning? She got upset; â€œWho do you think you are. I have only these ones. If you want other cap, then buy it yourself. I have five sons. And you are always the only one who is not happy with the things that I buy, why donâ€™t you be like the others (or should I say like â€œyour other siblingsâ€)?â€ She claimed."

Spanish,"Deadpoolâ€™s Poem I had to write a 40-line poem for my College English 101 Course, and I decided to write mine as if written from Deadpool's perspective. I hope you enjoy it. Comments and positive criticism are most welcomed, of course. I had to perform it before my peers and professor, so I read it in my Deadpool voice. I got many laughs, needless to say; it was Deadpool, after all. Deadpoolâ€™s Poem First, allow me to dedicate this poem to Bea Arthur. The world wonâ€™t be the same without her. Now, enough about Bea, Letâ€™s talk about me. Wade Wilsonâ€™s my real name, Being a merc (Thatâ€™s mercenary for short, kiddies) is my game. I was dying of cancer, So I thought joining Weapon X was my answer. Oh, they cured me alright, But now Iâ€™m so ugly, I gotta wear a mask all day and all night! Some people think Iâ€™m Spider-Man when they first see me in costume, Or so they like to assume. As if I would sell my marriage with the red hot supermodel to the devil! While I may be crazy, I assure you that in that regard, Iâ€™m quite on the level. Iâ€™ve made a few friends over the years like Blind Al, Weasel, Bob, and Cable, Who all canâ€™t stand when I put my feet up on the table. Iâ€™m also quite the ladies man, too. Syrin, Copy Cat, Death, Typhoid Mary, and Big Bertha are just a few. For those of you wondering just who I yam, Iâ€™m a comic book character, thatâ€™s what I yam! Oh, and I was in the Wolverine movie, Which clearly wasnâ€™t all that groovy. The minute that they decided to sew up my mouth, Is when that movie went south. But never fear, Ryan Reynolds the actor is here. He claims he wants to do my solo movie just right, So as to not cause a fan boy fight. I and fan boys everywhere swear that if his Green Lantern movie gets in the way, By God, he shall pay! Just how do I know all of this if Iâ€™m in a comic book, anyway? Well, boys and girls, I break the fourth wall each and everyday. Iâ€™m so popular, I have 3 monthly comic books. You should see how jealous Captain America looks. I recently had my 900th issue, Quick, somebody please pass the tissues. Iâ€™ve also been in a few videogames. Marvel Ultimate Alliance and X-Men Legends 2 are just a few of the names. Well, itâ€™s time for me to go. I gots a whole lotta people to kill and gotta collect me some dough."
Spanish,"King's Day â€œDÃ­a de reyesâ€. I think is one of the biggest dates for the Mexican children (although not for the parents). The day has his origins in the bibleâ€™s story about the three kings or wise men that gave gifts to the baby Jesus. On January 5th, the children put a shoe outside their bedrooms with a letter, asking for presents (usually toys). They also can send the letter on a balloon; itâ€™s fun to see the trees around those days, because you can see many balloons that get caught by the trees and didnâ€™t make his way to the sky. On the night of January 5th, the three kings leave the presents in the children's house. On the morning of January 6th, the children wake up and find their toys, the streets are empty. All the children are in home playing with their new toys. My favorite part of â€œDÃ­a de Reyesâ€ (maybe because Iâ€™m no longer a girl and I donâ€™t receive toys anymore) is the â€œRosca de Reyesâ€. Itâ€™s ring-shaped bread. The bread is so delicious; itâ€™s made with anise and orange. On top it has some crystallized fruits. Inside the bread, itâ€™s hidden a little figure of plastic (in the beginning was a porcelain figure) of a boy; itâ€™s supposed to be the kid-Jesus, but we call it â€˜monoâ€™ (the boy-doll, its kind of pejorative) or â€˜muÃ±equitoâ€™ (the little boy-doll). If you are eating your bread and you find something :), you probably are eating the muÃ±equitoâ€™s feet. But thatâ€™s something to celebrate! Because that means that youâ€™re the godfather of the boy Jesus and youâ€™re going to throw a party on February 2nd, the special food for that day is â€˜tamalesâ€™."

Spanish,"[ING 013] THE RE-TELLING STRATEGY THE RE-TELLING STRATEGY Hi everybody!! Today I want to talk about a learning strategy I have been using from some weeks ago. I want to share this learning method with you because it has been useful for me. It is the well-known strategy called â€œre-tellingâ€. The idea is simple, you have to write something, it can be something that happened to you in the past or a new you heard on the radio as well as a story your parents used to tell you when you were younger. It is important to say that what you want to say, in this case, has to have a body, I mean, the beginning, the middle and the ending. It is possible to raise this learning strategy in several ways. 1- The first one is the litteral re-telling strategy. Taking this strategy, you should try to repeat a text exactly as it was said. As an example, if your mother told you a tale beginning by: â€œonce upon a time in a far, far away land, there was a magic kingdomâ€¦â€ You should repeat exactly that frase. That kind of approach will help you to memorise sintax rules and intonation patterns as well as your long term memory. 2- The second one is similar to the previous one, but in this case it is not necessary to say it exactly as told. However it is necessary to keep the order of the narration. It could be called the direct telling strategy. Taking into account the previous phrase as an example, using this approach you can vary the elements used, maintaining the same content: â€œSomewhen in the past, in a distance no one imagines, a fantastic realm existed â€¦â€ This approach will develop your long-term memory as well as your lexical competence which youâ€™ll use to make an interpretation (like a singer) of the story. 3- In the third one you will change the order of the story, telling it litterally or with your own words but maintaining the same content of the story. It will help you to develop your communication abilities as well as your rethorical skills and long-term memory. 4- In the fourth approach, youâ€™ll tell the story in the original or your own order, but modifing some parts of the content. It could be the beginning, the middle or the ending. It will also help you to reinforce your communication abilities as well as your imagination, along with your rethorical skills. 5- In the fifth, and last case, youâ€™ll take some elements from the story and youâ€™ll create a new one from them. The elements you can choose from are: Vocabulary- Use the vocabulary you didnâ€™t know to practice it building a new story. Characters- You can use the same characters, but putting them in diffrerent settings with a different plot. Plot- You can use the same plot, but developing it with different characters. I have seen that some users have used it. As them, I have tried some of the different approaches, with magnificent results. There are several ways to learn. The ideas above are just some of the points you can take into account but you have surely found other points of viewâ€¦ What do you think about this? Have you ever tried it? Was it good for you? Looking forward for your always really appreciated feedback!!"

I would like to know if the speech is fine. Here is speech. I want to say thanks to ""the life"" for being today here, in Japan, with Miwa. Thanks to Miwa I realised that with effort, believing in oneself, everything is possible. ""Miwa, the life bring to us special gifts and you are my best gift that I have never received. Our life started in Toronto even when we did not know. I can say that I was waiting for you. Do you remember it? And when we were far away, you always believed in our relationship that today we are together. Miwa, you are a very special person. I am so happy because you are my wife. We know that for being couple we need to respect eachother, to have patience and something very important, being the best friend"". Every one need to know this. Like every couple, sometimes we fight. However, even when she is mad with me, I am Happy for being in Japan with you, Miwa. ""Hi, so desu"" Maybe somebody is thinking ""Sogoi, Oscar is speaking japanese"". Yeap, I am speaking japanese but this is posible because Hana, Suki, Hiroe, Chana and Mimami. Thank you very much And I want to say a very special thanks. KYOKO thank you very much. Maybe without your help, today I could not be in Japan. Kyoko, you know the reason. And Thank everyone for come to the Costemia Anniversary, Valentin`s Day and Oscar and Miwa Weddings Party. Maybe almost everyone knows that I met Miwa dancing salsa in Toronto. And today, one more time, we are going to dance together. And This is for all you for being sharing a this special moment. Thank you very much. And now, Let`s go to dance salsa."

Spanish,"Controversial traditional celebrations in Spain One of the most famous celebrations of Spain is ""Bullfight"". In Spanish it's called ""Corrida de toros"". A man wearing traditional costumes called ""Torero"" fight with a Bull. The Torero has a speacil sword and some spears. He has to hurt the Bull with it, and prevent that the Bull don't him. (it's difficult for the Bull to hit the Torero, because before the celebration somehow inject something to the Bull that makes it feel a little bit sleepy, like a drug) Later, when the Bull is completly bleeding, the Torero kill it. This celebration is done so often, specially during the summer. And most of Spanish people go to see it, and some foreign people, too. Why is this celebration so interesting??? Why is make a Bull suffer and then kill it interesting??? That Bull has no gulty!! Poor Bull !! It's an animal and it has to be respected!! But the Torero and all the people who see it has no respect to it!!! This celebration makes me feel ashmed of being Spanish T. T Now in CataluÃ±a Region (Barcelona is in CataluÃ±a) it's forbidden. And I'm happy about it. But some other Regions still celebrate it. This celebration is really controversial in Spain because there are people (me included) who want to forbid it in the whole country. But in the other hand, there are a lot of people who don't want it to be banished, because It's a Historical Celebration. They say that the Bull doesn't suffer Â¬Â¬ Who the hell believe it!!!! A Bull bleeding doesn't suffer??? That's completely false!! I don't know If this celebration it's also done in other countries, I hope not. What do you thing about this Celebration?? I hate it."

This is not a history it is an opinion on certain people that I know they could be candidates to local heroes, or my heroes, I consider them heroes because they have always been when but I need them, since when I have problems they always tell me the own advice for the situation in which I am. Them always apart from worrying about me they worry also about other people although they don't thank them later, they do their daily activities; she is a housewife and he is police's official, the one works very hard, although most people always criticize a lot for his work, but he doesn't care, he always says â€œthat a person is classified by her actionsâ€, while she always worries about her family and that all this well, not caring if she has to give up her dreams, both they are sacrificed so that his are well.

It is said that ""The Kiss"" of Gustave klimt is one of the masterpiece with more merchandise in the history. It was painted in the golden period of the author. The painting is about a kiss between two lovers. The woman is on her knees, and you may think that the man is in the same position. They both are covered by golden clothes. It is important to point out the fact that the woman's hair is red. It looks that Klimt loved women with red hairs, and many of his paintings are filled with them."

Spanish,"operating systems Most people use Windows, which is the most popular operating system all over the world. However there are others operating systems and this is a fact that many users donâ€™t know. Usually people buys a computer with Windows already installed on it, so they think Windows is the only operating system. That is not true. There are more than one hundred operating systems and every operating system has his advantages and disadvantages. However almost everyone use Windows. I want to present Linux as a better alternative than Windows. It is important to point out that Windows and Linux are different. So you shouldnâ€™t expect to find a button Start, or the same Control Panel with the same options. Usually you would complete all tasks you do on windows in a different way on Linux. They are sometimes similar but never equal. So you should be patient to learn a different way to do things. However you would be satisfied when you accomplish your learning."

Spanish,"Underachivement/Causes Bilingualism is often signaled as one of the causes of minority childrenâ€™s academic underachievement. A common belief is that bilinguals have two under developed languages; while monolinguals have one well developed language. However, according to several theories this is not true. Moreover, the Threshold s theory explains that balanced bilingualism may lead to higher levels of cognition, and only when both languages are under developed detrimental effects such as academic failure may occur. In addition, lack of exposure to the majority language has also been attributed as reason for ELLâ€™s under achievement. Consequently, mainstreaming and transitional forms of bilingual education attempt to ensure a fast conversion to the majority language. Yet, this can stand the chance of doing more harm than good. It denies the childâ€™s skills in the home language, the cognitive and academic competence in that language and often it denies the identity and self-respect of the child itself. On the contrary, bilingual education when effective implemented is not the cause of under achievement; rather it is the cure (p. 206) Furthermore, mismatch between home and school is also one of the factors for bilingual studentâ€™s underachievement. For that reason, the alternative view is that, where practicable the school system should be flexible enough to incorporate the home language and the culture. A mismatch between home and school can be positively addressed by strong forms of bilingual education for language minorities (p. 207). Overall, the real causes of underachievement tend to lie in relative social and economic deprivation and exclusion, a school which rejects the home language and culture of the child, and occasionally real learning difficulties (p. 210)."

Spanish,"HOW NICE IS TO TRAVEL Last year I went to Europe. When I arrived in France it was raining. We had a wonderfull trip. First of all we went to our hotel. Then we walked around the city. It is a great Country, the people were friendly. I had never been before there. We couldn't go up to the Eiffel tower because there were a lot of people trying to go up. But we could see all the city when we went to Montmarre. We also went to Versalles, some friends had told me that Versalles is a great place and it is true. I had never seen a palace like the Versalles Palace. I recomend to visit it. How nice is to travel."

Spanish,"Blog Hello Everyone! How are you doing with your language studies?. I would like to talk about my new Blog. It's a blog I created today to share my resources of Korean with people who are studying Korean as well. But I have a little problem with creating blogs (and forums) and publishing entries on them, because I am not constant, I mean, I delete blogs when I am bored of it or when I feel like they are a waste of time. The blogs I created before were not about Language Learning or Languages itself, they were about Anime (japanese animated series), asiatic culture in general, and I deleted all of them. I also thought on creating blogs about what I like such as Vegetarian Cooking and Korean Music, but I didn't create any of them. Now I am worried that I may also feel like that and delet this new blog. Because it can be a waste of time then but at the same time it can be very helpful, for me because I can review all I have learned and for people who are looking for some resources of this language. I decided to write this here because I'm committing myself and committing with you not to give up with this. And because I also want to promove my blog hehe (http: // room-501. blogspot. com/) Ok everyone, have a good weekend and thanks for the corrections in advance. ^^"

Despite this limitation, it becomes the agent Ilpalazzo favorite, but Hyatt is shown unaware of his condition, does not give much help to Excel for his disease and the link between leader and follower.

The first step in the plan for world domination is to begin by focusing on one city in order to minimize setbacks. Across consists of the leader of the organization, Il Palazzo, and officers Excel and Hyatt. Excel and Hyatt live in an apartment building in the city, along with their pet dog Menchi, who is also their emergency food supply, and are later joined by Elgala, another Across officer. Living in the same apartment building are three friends Iwata, Sumiyoshi and Watanabe, along with co-worker Matsuya, and later Ropponmatsu, who work for the Department of City Security under Dr Kabapu. Eventually the members of Across begin making appeals directly to the City's citizens before Il Palazzo publicly declares the existence of Across and its intentions to the public. Hyatt is captured and Excel and Elgala are later held in an immigrant detention center before being rescued by Il Palazzo, who begins the new phase of his plans. History of FLCL (ãƒ•ãƒªã‚¯ãƒª) Furi Kuri FLCL revolves around Naota. His life is interrupted by the arrival of Haruko Haruhara, who bursts on the scene by running Naota over with her Vespa scooter, then giving him CPR and hitting him on the head with a blue vintage Rickenbacker 4001 left-handed electric bass guitar. Later, Naota is shocked to find Haruko working in his house as a live-in maid. Since then, Giant Robots from Medical Mechanica have been coming out of Naota's head and cause more problems for Naota and Haruko. Haruko is using Naota for her search for the Pirate King, Atomsk, which puts her at odds with Medical Mechanica, the monolithic industrial corporation. At the same time, Naota is being watched by Commander Amarao, who believes that Medical Mechanica is out to conquer the galaxy. The combination of circumstances gets Naota involved in a three-way battle between Haruko, Amarao and Medical Mechanica. The underlying theme is Naota's coming of age as he becomes more mature and learns to express his feelings."

Spanish,"Pita Discovers A New Word Today, I tried to do a translation of a tale called ""Pita descubre una palabra nueva"". I don't remember the author's name, I just remember that I read this tale when I was 8 years old. I was in the primary. It's a memory of my childhood. Below I wrote the story's first part. Soon, I'll write the second one. PITA DISCOVERS A NEW WORD One morning, Tomas and Anita came into the Pita's kitchen and they said to her good morning, but Pita didn't answer. She just smiled with dreamy expression. ""Excuse me for not responding your greeting; I'm thinking about the thing I discovered right now"" Pita said. ""What have you discovered?"" ""A new word! A marvelous word!"" ""What kind of word?"" Tomas inquired with some distrust. ""A wonderful word. One of the best I've heard in my life."" ""Come on, say it to us, Pita"" the children said. ""Palitroche!"" Pita said triumphantly. ""Palitroche? What's its meaning? ""I wish I know it!"" ""If you don't know what it means, it is useless"" Anita said. ""That worries me"" Pita answered, bitting her right hand thumb. ""Who say what words mean?"" Tomas asked. ""I think that some old masters did a meeting"" Pita said.""They invented some words and later they said: this word means it... , but no one never thought a word as beautiful as palitroche. What luck that I found it! I bet you everything you want that I'll discover what it means! Maybe it can be used with the noise we make when walking on the mud. Let's listen to how it sounds: When Anita is walking on the mud a wonderful palitroche can be heard... No, it doesn't sounds good. That isn't it. Maybe it's something which can be bought in stores. Let's find out it!"" ""And let's see if we can"" Tomas added. Pita went to seek her purse and filled it with coins. ""Palitroche sounds like a thing too expensive. Probably this money is enough. Once agreed, they three went out the house."

Spanish,"Just practicing Hi, everybody So, I'm trying to improve my English writing skills. I've been using the language for several years but I still feel that sometimes I don't know if I am writing just as a translator from my native language (Spanish) or if I am really communicating in good English. Sometimes when I post something online there are people that notice that am not a native English speaker. Why is that? I suppose that the reason is that I fail to use common language idioms and sometimes just write overly complicated things. Anyway, I hope that practicing constantly will eventually make me have abetter understanding of well written English. Thanks in advance for any help and improvement advice!"
Spanish,"Health food. We must eat good because if we don't eat properly maybe in the future we'll have problem of health. For this reason it's important eat different types of dishes, for example pasta, rice, soup, spaghetti or paella, vegetables, legumes, cold meat, fruit and also it's important eat bread and drink four litres of water a day. If you want eat once a week a piece of chocolate or different variety of sweet don't worry you can eat it because also it's good for your organism because need sugar. In my opinion mediterranean food in this moment it's the best food in the world because have differents thing that are good for our organism and american food with hamburger and hot dog it's bad because produces lot of fat."

Spanish,"Haiti earthquake Hum... This is tomorrow's homework, please, could you help me with some mistakes? My final examen is in two days, I'm really nervous Haiti earthquake Haiti last earthquake was on January 12th, 2010, at 04:53 pm; its epicenter was near LÃ©ogÃ¢ne, approximately 25 km east of Port-Au-Prince. Haiti has been a very poor country that is located in a hug vulnerable place in Central America, between Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean. This country has a history of earthquakes, hurricanes and cyclones, and many fights because they were a monarchy after a French colony. Most of the houses were very weak, so they went destroyed. They neither have an enough strong government to confront the terrible disaster. Many buildings collapsed, like the hospital, the harbor and the trade centers, so did the telephonic lines, roads and most of the structures. There are thousands of casualties, missing people, and even if many countries are sending help, and numerous people around the world are organizing campaigns, the disaster would claim between 100,000 to 200,000 lives. The Haitian authorities confirmed that they had buried 150,000 people twelve days after the earthquake. Public figures died, like the Archbishop of Haiti, Haitian blue helmets lieder and musicians. In my opinion, I think it is a very pitiful event, because Haiti was a broke country whose economy has never been good, and this disaster just difficult the situation. Now, the country has to start again, organize a new government, heal people and restructure the city, with all the help, I hope for the best, because they all need a new opportunity. However, the international aid makes us understand that when we help each other, especially in times of need and when the nature is not as peaceful as usually, we can build a better world."

Spanish,"Playing a great game Yesterday I was playing ""Empire Earth II"", to be more specific... a random skirmish, There were ten players, including me, the selected map was ""mediterranean"", my starting position was in the north, beside the red and the yellow player. I chose the british civilization, because it has good cavalry to combat other civilizations. Since the start of the game, I had fifteen minutes to take territories, build and prepare an army to defend myself. But, I'm not faster, so in the minute fifteen, I had three territories and buildings, but not an army. The other players were prepared for a war, so I had to build lots of walls in the frontiers, towers, and fortresses. I signed agreements with the closest players, because I don't wanted a war. However, the most distant players declared the war to me. Fortunately, those players were too far to attack me, however they send their ships to attack my ports, my reaction was faster, so I sent my frigates to defend the coastline. That was my first victory, but only would be the beginning..."

Cantonese,"A Letter Dear All, I am sorry to call you attention that English Corner as our routine active of English Learners' Association has been witnessing the participants in a dwindling trend, anyway this is the common phenomenon, which I could accept. First of all, I am to be blamed for not attending much often due to whatever reasons. However I do believe that all the members should never give up learning even without presence at the scene. So, I would like to share with you the following three comments: English learning is a self-activated process which is tough but full of surprise and happiness, I do hope that everyone could find joyness in the process of learning and make big progress. English corner activites is a platform which is not easy to be established, so I do hope that it will be always there even only several participants involved each time. It is a magic thing for all of us to meet regularly and share in another language and make friends. Nansha project is now going smoothly, so I can expect more people who are fond of and good at English will find more chances to get involved. If anyone has the interest in working as interpreter, please don't quit learning but try hard to make yourself ready for future potential opportunities. Best Regards, Shirley"

Cantonese,"English problem Which of the following would you say? A. I've just been told that she is going to Italy in January 2012. B. I've just been told that she was going to Italy in January 2012. C. I was just told that she was going to Italy in January 2012. D. I was just told that she is going to Italy in January 2012. Some told me that ""was just told"" was not correct because ""just"" would normally be used with perfect tense. Some told me otherwise. Some told me that ""was going to"" was not correct because January 2012 wasn't a time in the past. Some told me otherwise. Therefore, I need your help! Thanks!"

Cantonese,"Which do you prefer eat outside or eat at home? Toefl writing Q. Some people prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants. Other peopole prefer to preaper and eat food at home. Which do you prefre? Use specifice reasons and examples to support your answer. Some people choose to eat outside while others choose to eat at home. I prefer to eat at restaurants for the following reasons. The major benefit of choosing to eat outside is that we can save time. As the old saying goes, â€œTime is money.â€ If we eat outside, we do save our time to go to supermarket or traditional market to choose the food ingredients for cooking a meal. Moreover, we can eat at anytime just as we want. Thus, we will not be constrained by time. We can arrange our schedule more flexibly. In other words, eating outside is â€œsaving our moneyâ€. Apart from saving time, we can have a variety of choices on food. We like diversification. If we eat similar kind of food everyday, we will feel bored soon. Therefore, we eat outside so that we can change our choices according to our emotional status. In addition, eating outside can make us understand different cultures of regions. For instance, as the main food of Asian countries is rice whereas the main food of Western countries is wheat. If we donâ€™t understand the reason, we can inquire the owners of those restaurants. Hence, we can learn more through eating outside. Finally, we can interact with people more through eating outside. For students, they can ascend their friendship through eating outside. For businessmen, they can choose restaurants according the preference and character tics of the customers. They usually can hammer a deal through eating outside. Therefore, if we can become more successfully through eating outside. It is true that there are some advantages to eat at home. However, as a college students, my home is far from campus. Therefore, it is more convenient for me eating outside rather than eating at home. So I prefer to eat at outside. (Word count: 307 words)"
Cantonese,"My dream boy David (By AndyWong) Hi everybody, this is one of my writing assignment. I just want to share with all of you and hope you can correct my work. (Written by Andy Wong from Hong Kong, China.) Dear diary, Yesterday, my dream boy David asked me. ""Amy, would you like to go to the cinema with me on Saturday? "" ""What? Shut up! Am I hearing the truth? "" I thought. I was shocked! I consented his invitation nervously and unnaturally. It isn't believed to be the truth! Do you know what I feel? After school, I went to a Fashion shop and also salon. Because this was the first time I dated my dream boy David, I must give him a good first impression. My hair became flamboyant after I had had my hair cut. I also bought fashionable clothes and a pair of boots. Last night, I couldn't help thinking what would happen tomorrow. I even couldn't sleep! Today, I woke up early. I spent lots of time setting my flamboyant hair and wearing my new clothes. Everything was perfect. I then left home with my promise to my Mum. Not to come home late. I arrived at the cinema fifteen minutes earlier. Ten minutes left, five minutes left... The more the time near, the faster my heart pounded. ""Will he like my look today?"" I asked myself. Suddenly, ""Hey! Amy! How are you?"" It was David! My heart was pounding more quickly. ""What? Who is the girl standing next to David? Is she Tammy? She is really pretty and cool today!"" Tammy then hugged David. ""What is Tammy doing with my dream boy? Oh my goodness! Is she David's girlfriend? Why didn't David tell me?"" I thought without saying anything. My heart was really sour. Tammy then recognized me. She shouted in astonishment ""Wow! Amy? What's wrong with your silly baby clothes and your crap hair? Are you sick?"" I could feel that David also couldn't help laughing at me. Everyone in the cinema could hear Tammy's speech. Many of them were looking at me. Some of them were even pointing at me. At that time, I could feel that my face was burning hotter and hotter. My tear was dropping without my control and I started crying. ""I was not expected to be laughed. David is supposed to be with me, isn't it?"" I kept running out of the cinema and kept asking myself. Ultimately, I went to the stairs. I seat there and cried. No one was interested in caring about me. At last, I stood up and rubbed my eyes. I calmed down and went home. Yes! Maybe I'm not attractive enough. Maybe I should forget about David. It was almost ten o'clock when I was back. Alas, maybe it was just my wishful thinking. I should try to forget about it, shouldn't I? But right now, I am just wondering what will happen on Monday when I get into my classroom. Alas! Will David and Tammy tell my classmate and my friends my silly behavior? Will they think that I'm ridiculous? I just can't imagine that everyone is laughing at me and I am isolated. Oh! What should I do now? Should I pretend that I am sick on Monday so that I do can stay at home instead of meeting them? So confused! Can anyone help me? (Written by Andy Wong from Hong Kong, China.)"

Cantonese,"Would you help me correct the following writing? P. S It is a letter to persuade parents not to stop students' physical edcation. Feel free to make corrections and give comments. Dear parents, On behalf of the Student Union,I am writing in response to many parents' request for stopping offering PE lessons to S5-S7 students. However,sport will bring more advantages than disadvantages,and moreover benefit to both the students and the society. Obviously,Sport can teach students big life lessons. There are always failure and success in the competitions. we can learn from failure gradully and will not easily give up. Persistency is one of the essence to be successful in both academic work and sports development. Also,teamspirit can be developed through sport. Being cooperative with others is always important no matter in school or in work. we can be educated to accommodate ourselves in order to achieve a common goal with the teammates. Those life skills cannot be fully acquired in a single activity except in sport. Secondly,sport can prevent students from indulging bad habits. Nowadays,drug abuse is common among students. Those who take drugs usually don not have any talents and interests,so they use drugs to relieve their pressure. But once students cultivate their interests in sport ,their targets will be clear and they know how to cope with pressure. sport is a healthy way to help us relax ourselves. Thirdly,sport can help ease the welfare burden of the gorvernment. Having regular exercises can keep us healthy. If everone is healthy,the medical welfare provided by the government can be reduced. The excess resources could use on education. Morever, a healthy labour force would also have higher productivity,thus,the economy can have faster growth. In short,sport can benefit the society. It is understandable that parents often have concerns that students may get distracted from studying. However,sport may help students' studying to a certain extent. Especially for senior students,the need to have a healthy body in order to cope with heavy workload. Doing sport is one of the ways to maintain health. Moreover, senior students have to sit for public examination very soon. They may feel anxious. Recently, cases of students suicide are increasing,The students involved do not know how to deal with their anxiety. Some of them feel upset about their results. The common cause is that they feel desperate. Sport can probably cheer them up. Parents usually put students' benefit on the top of the list. BY considering the benefits of students and the society. Stopping offering PE lessons would not be a good idea. We sincerely hope that parents can have serious consideration of the proposal again."

Cantonese,"Adults Only This is my first English entry in Lang-8 and it maybe the last one . Normally ,I would like to write down my essay in Japanese.. This is an exception ,I think. The first language came to my mind is English . And I couldn't find one word of this topic in Japanese. So I wrote down this entry in English , just following my heart.. Or maybe Iâ€™m so shy that I canâ€™t write it in Japanese or I don't want to . Anyway, itâ€™s okay , I think . I have to warn you that what I talk today is something about sex . If you feel sick about this topic, you had better go now . Thanks for reading. If you insist on reading this entry and youâ€™re under 18 years-old ,please read it with an adult , thanks. Last night I waked up at the midnight cause I felt hungry. I put on my coat and went downstairs to find something to eat. When I passed by my parentsâ€™ room,a thought came to my mind. I should ask my mum directly . Mum , Iâ€™m so hungry now, anything to eat? I didn't say it out . cause I heard some voice that indicated that they were having sex at the moment.. So I kept silent and not to aloud them, cause itâ€™s impolite to disturb them. Without any thought , I went directly to the kitchen then opened the fridge to find something to eat.. Luckily ,thereâ€™s some bread left. After eating the bread, I felt a little full and went back to my bed to sleep. As I was not hungry anymore and really sleepy at that time, I fell into sleep soon. Today is Saturday ,I don't have to go out but I got up as usual. Mum was preparing our breakfast at that time while singing her favourite song. Yan: mum , youâ€™re so happy today, can you share it with me? Mum: hummâ€¦ we had sex last night. Itâ€™s more than two years since we did it last time.. While listening to what mumâ€™s saying ,I thought of one scene from one J-Drama. A couple were having sex at the midnight inside their bedroom. Their children stand outside and had a conversation like that: Brother in law: what are you doing here? Do you have some mental problem? Sister: They are happy, arenâ€™t they. I wish mum could be happy all the time. I felt the girlâ€™s love to her mother at that time. To be honest , I don't know the true meaning of sex. But a coupleâ€™s life without sex ,itâ€™s not a good thing, IMO. Thanks for finishing reading."

Cantonese,"Oh no, summer! â€œShit! Gecko!â€ I shouted when I was back to house last week. It was lying on my desk, doing nothing maybe. I fetch a besom and swept it down to the floor. It was smart, because it hid to the back of my computer. I just stared at the exit, looking for opportunity to kill it. In fact, I was more terrified than it, cause I think if touched by it, I will feel like dying. At last, it came out, and swept away by me. I had thought it was the end of the war, but I saw another one last night. Gecko is not the most annoying creature in summer, but mosquito. My English teacher told me the most uncomfortable thing in China is mosquito, which is hardly could be found in Britain. Even if I made several defensive lines, I can find several new mosquito bites on my skin. If the gecko promises me to eliminate every mosquito at sight, I will make a house for its whole family. Heat also make my computer work slower, which makes me embarrassed when I play computer games online, say Company of Heroes. Now many players just kick me off when they see my computer performance too bad. This is situation that will not occur in winter. Well, maybe I should be more optimistic. After all, summer just lasts six months in Guangzhou, not a whole year. Thank God, I am not living in tropical area."

Cantonese,"Should Children's TV Time be limited? Nowadays, almost every family has one (or more than one, probably), television. Needless to say, TV now becomes an integral part of our life. However, when it comes to children, who are expected to do well at school, should parents limit the hours that they spend on watching TV? Basically, my answer is yes.(54) First and foremost, young as they are, children are undergoing a special period which is lack of self control. If parents fail to educate them properly and leave them alone to abandon themselves in watching TV, they will probably become one of those lacking self controls. They might not be able to arrange their time appropriately and have trouble in allotting their studying time in different subjects. They might fail to control themselves when they are exposed to some kinds of allures, like smoking, alcohol, or even drugs, which can lead to very serious consequences. Furthermore, watching TV can damage our health. With eyes glued to the screen, watching their favorite cartoons, children can end up with poor eyesight. Without necessary exercises and always sitting still in sofa, accompanied by chips, it is possible that children exercise too little and become obesity. In addition, watching TV can also, to some extent, affect the relationship between patients and children adversely. It is very likely for them to quarrel with each other about what programs should be watched. And even if they agree on watching the same program, glancing at the screen silently, which is often the case, actually deprives their opportunity to communicate with each other. Admittedly, watching TV do have some advantages. For instance, some educational program can teach children in an interesting way, even drama can provide them with some topics to discuss with their friends. However, it's disputable that watching TV excessively will do more harm than good for them. Consequently, for their own sake, children's time on watching TV should be limited."

Cantonese,"Wanna improve my written English, especially my grammar This is my first time to use Lang-8. I get to know Lang-8 because I have seen a post on a forum about how to improve different languages. The my experience is that I have learnt English for many years, however, I still find my english skills are not good enough and it is also difficult for me to use a new vocaburary. The thing that I always face is that I know what a word mean, but it is difficult for me to use them when I write my passage. I really don't know the reason behind. I have memorized lots of vocaburaries, but the diction that i used are still very limited. While I am composing my writing, I can't think of any other words to help me explaining further. Also, I always find my writings are so childish. It gives me a feeling that these passages are written by a little girl, but now I am 21 years old already. If anyone helped me to correct my passage, I hope that you can give some suggestions to me, in order I can change my style of writing. Thankyou so much~~"

Cantonese,"advertisements waste money and time of companies because consumers know what they want to buy. More and more advertisements appear in our daily lives in different forms, like television, newspaper, even internet, etc.. I am often disturbed by various advertisements when I am watching NBA games so that I canâ€™t help hoping to eradicate all advertisements from TV programs. However, this does not mean that I advocate the above statement. Just the opposite, I admit the importance of advertisements play in our daily life. Most of them donâ€™t waste of money but benefits our daily lives, and at the same time help to improve the performance of business which made these advertisements. In daily lives, we do know what we want to buy but in most time we do not know which to buy. Advertisements help us make buying choice and save shopping time. The rapid development of economies brings us so many goods that we often become lost in thousands of similar products with different brands. Sometimes, even products from the same manufacturer might have more detailed types with different characteristics and fit for different kinds of groups. One obvious example is the cosmetic. There are six different types of Nevia Face Care for men, and simply through reading the introduction book embedded in the package, one often canâ€™t know about their specific utilities and hard to make a choice, not to mention whether the customers have enough time to read the book. Television advertisements, which contain specific introduction to products, price information and the ways how we could purchase, reduce the time we may spend on researching and help us chose the most suitable ones. Therefore, advertisements are not waste but do help to our lives. From the perspective of the manufacturers, advertisements not only help them sell more products but also can accumulate the reputation and elevate the brand value for one product or one company. The rapid economic development also brings intense competition among companies. In order to sell more products, company must take measures to let more customers to know about their products and then choose to purchase products. Many survey data researches have demonstrated the positive relationship between the increase rate of sales and the expenditures on ads of one company. In modern market, no company must find the potential customers through various measures, including ads, or the failure will not be avoided. On the other hand, more and more companies begin to realize that they are not only to sell the products but to found an organization with some intrinsic value, which will in turn help to improve the companyâ€™s performance in market. Nokia is the famous cell-phone producer form Finland. It not only promotes the specific products in ads, like the N series, but also continuously stress the companies basic belief â€œConnecting Peopleâ€. Consequently, we are attracted to buy its products, at the same time we could have in common with its values. Of course, there are some fraudulent ads that delude the customers into sending in money and damage the reputation of the company. Too much ads do harm to our normal lives. But, these are other questions and will not deny the value of ads. A good advertisement is beneficial to both the customers and the company."

Review of the development of the car, I found that it is in Arts and Craft Movement period (1875 -1915) Rickshaws are a mode of: a runner draws a two-wheeled cart which seats one or two persons. The word rickshaw came from Asia where they were mainly used as means of transportation for the social elite. However, in more recent times rickshaws have been outlawed in many countries in Asia due to numerous accidents. Nevertheless, what are the things develop to â€œRickshawsâ€??? Arriving to the data statistic, we can extrapolate that the most possibility thing progress to rickshaws would be â€œBicycleâ€. To modify the weakness of the bicycle, rickshaws have been modifying achieve to carry passenger and more than 1 people. This improvement is a great design which can help descendant a lot and inspire them an initial idea to study the vehicle. Runner pulled rickshaws has mainly been replaced in Asia by bicycle rickshaws. They are also common in Western cities like New York City. In London they are known as pedicabs, and in San Diego they are called bike taxis. The term ""rickshaw"" is today commonly used for those vehicles as well, but this article deals exclusively with runner-pulled rickshaws. The word ""rickshaw"" originates from the Japanese word jinrikisha which literally means ""human-powered vehicleâ€ By improving different drawback of Human power transport â€“ Rickshaws, some countries was elaborating it to mechanization. An auto rickshaw is a motor vehicle and a mode of transport in South and East Asia, for private use and as a vehicle for hire. It is a motorized version of the traditional rickshaw or velotaxi, a small three-wheeled cart operated by a single individual, and is related to the cabin cycle. An auto rickshaw is generally characterized by a sheet-metal body or open frame resting on three wheels, with handle bars like a motorcycle, a canvas roof with drop-down sides, a small cabin in the front of the vehicle for the driver (sometimes called an auto-wallah), and seating space for up to three passengers in the rear. They are generally fitted with an air-cooled scooter version of a two-stroke engine, with handlebar controls instead of a steering wheel. Auto rickshaws are light duty vehicles. How can Rickshaws popular in Hong Kong? -Rickshaws were first imported to Hong Kong from Japan in 1874. They were a popular form of transport for many years, peaking at more than 3,000 in the 1920s. However, their popularity waned after World War II. No new licenses for rickshaws have been issued since 1975, and only a few old menâ€”about four as of 2002â€”still ply their trade, mainly for tourists."

However, today my English teacher told us that we had to stay after school for doing more and more exercises. So, you could imagine that how busy we would. We must study until 6:00pm, or maybe longer. To be honest, although I like studing English, I don't think this move can work. On the whole day, we are all exercising on different subjects. And you can understand it in ease, if you do too many similar works, just continue training and training, you will be very tried and you can't work up the enthusiasm. For these reasons, I think this action will just maltreat us and it can't make any help for our study. It will never work."

Cantonese,"Newspaper cutting(1) Q1. Do you think convenience stores should give customers free plastic bags when the 50-cent plastic bag levy comes into force on 7th July? (BG INFO: Hongkong is going to have 50-cent plastic bag levy come into force on 7th July. 50c HKD= 0.07 USD) I think the convenience stores should not give customers free plastic bags. As we all know, the pollution in Hong Kong is very serious. One of the pollution is solid waste pollution. Our waste ends up in garbage dumps that takes up and destroys more and more land every day. First of all, when we go to convenience shop and supermarkets, we ought to bring our own bag. Our landfills are getting fuller and fuller. Most plastic bags are not biodegradable, and therefore we should bring our own bag. Also, those convenience shops are considering giving out free paper bags. It goes without saying that production of paper bags will result in deforestation and our planet is having fewer and fewer trees. Deciding to use paper bags instead of plastic bags is not a wise move. Besides, some big cities in the Mainland China, like Shenzhen, have started to implement plastic bag levy. Most consumers are willing to pay the levy, and some even bring their own bag. The environmental sense in China is gradually increasing. All in all, I think the convenience stores should not give customers free plastic bags because of our environment. Q2. What is your opinion on the new medium-of-instruction policy? (MOI=Medium of instruction/CMI=Chinese as [the language of] Medium of Instruction) There are many comments saying that the new MOI policy is pleasing parents who treat Chinese-medium teaching inferior and desire more English teaching at school. I support the new medium-of-instruction policy. There are several reasons: I think nowadays the standard of English of Hong Kong students is far too low. Compared to other ESL countries, most Hong Kong students do not have a high standard of English and indirectly decreasing the competitiveness of Hong Kong. Since 1980s, the government started encouraging secondary schools using Cantonese as the MOI, but the effect is not so obvious. In 1999, the government gave instructions of MOI, resulting in an increase of CMI schools from 12% to 75%. In fact, the standard of English of CMI schools is not satisfactory. In 2005, 78% of candidates participated in English (Syllabus A) examination and failed in HKALE. On the other hand, for CMI students, there are some great improvements in some subjects such as Mathematics, Geography, History, Economics and so on. One cannot deny that using Cantonese as MOI will help students understand the lesson more easily. In conclusion, I think the new medium-of-instruction policy is the most suitable way for both EMI and CMI students."

Cantonese,"Saving Money Is The Best Policy Nowadays, a recent survey show that 67 percent of students think that saving money is a good habit. However, some people believe that using tomorrow's money today is better. But I don't see eye to eye with them and I insist that saving money is preferable to overspending. I have two reasons to support my views. First of all, if you put aside money, you won't feel desperate in case of some accidents. For example, when one of your family members catches a serious disease,we can save he/she by affording a timely cure. In addition, saving money for tomorrow won't keep us worried about the bills. Many people buy many more than they can afford, and they often feel quite pressed to pay back the payment of the credit card. From the foregoing, we can safely draw a conclusion that saving money for tomorrow is beneficial, as a proverb goes, be prepared and you won't be sorry."
Cantonese,"Last Day Today was the last day I had my drum lessons. Actually, I only had 8 lessons by now. I couldnt have it because I dun have enough money for further lessons.

Cantonese,"Gold vending machine I start to learn English from BBC Learning Englsih website, but when I try to listen the sound clisp, I couldn't hear out all of them, can anyone help me see did I hear worng? The following was what I heard from the website. http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/general/sixminute/2009/07/090702_6min_vending.shtml Dima: Hello and welcome to this edition of 6 Minute English with me Dima Kostenko. Kate: and me, Kate Colin. Dima: Kate will be our language guide for today. Today we'll hear a fascinating report about a new vending machine that's unlike any other. But first, Kate, how would descript what a vending machine is? Kate: Well, a vending machine is a machine that you can buy things from most oftener things you can buy to eat on the go such as crisps, choloates, sandwiches and I've actually seen some vending machines sell books in airport. Dima: That's reall interesting, that's something isn't it. Kate: Yeah, I know, I was really suprised when I saw it. It's a very good idea, if you're in a rush and you're running to catach a plane. Dima: Absolutely yes. Kate: Now you pay for these items by inserting a coin through a slot, so these machines are also known sometime as a slot machine. Dima: That's not be quite colloquial though. Kate: Exactly, slot machine can also be known any kind of machines that you put money into, it doesn't have to just be vending machine. Dima: Right! Kate: They can also be known as a dispenser because they dispense, they give us something to the end of the transaction. Dima: Well, Kate, if you're only using vending machines to buy things like chocolate bars or books, you're in for a suprise. As Steve Rosenberg, the BBC's correspondent in Berlin has discovered a German company is planning to install some very different dispensers at stations, airports and shopping centers. Would you like to hear more? Kate: Well, hearing all these phrases from you 'very different' and 'unlike any other' I must say I am a bit intrigued. Dima: You won't be intrigied for too much longer because in a moment we'll hear from Steve Rosenberg to find out what those machine will be selling. I'll say just one thing, it's something really valuable. Kate: OK, let's listen. And as you're listening try to find out what it is they are selling. Also listen out for these words and phrases. 'On the go goodies' meaning small things that we buy and consume without stopping like chocolate bars, crisps and other snacks for example. And 'precious' which means very expensive and valuable. Dima: Here's Steve Rosenberg. Steve: I'm standing next to a vending machine at a Berlin railway station. It offers a typical selection of on the go goodies. There are fizzy drinks and crisps, chewing gum. But very soon, machines like this one could be selling something far more precious than a packet of peanuts. As well as chocolate bars you'll be able to buy gold bars. Dima: So, Kate, what is it that the new vending machine will be selling. Kate: Well, Steve says it isn't going to be on the go goodies. Not chewing gum, not packets of peanuts. It will be the precious metal gold. Well, sounds interesting. But I'm not quite sure I understand, why would anyone want to buy a gold bar from a slot machine? Dima: Well, apparently, with the global financial crisis more and more people decide that they can no longer rely upon stocks and shares the way they used to. Kate: 'Stocks and shares' that's a useful expression, often heard among business people. It means part of the ownership of a company which people can buy as an investment. Dima: Indeed they can. But in reality many start turning to other types of investment which they consider safer, like buying precious metals. And with this new slot machine, buying gold simply can't be easier. The price will be adjusted daily, and in the next part Steve Rosenberg quotes some prices at current rates. And here comes your challenge for this week. Which currency unit is mentioned? Euro, dollar or pound? Kate, which of these three currencies would you expect to hear in a report about gold, recorded in Germany by a reporter of a British broadcaster? Kate: Oh, that's a tricky one and I think I would have to say euro because that's the currency used in Germany. Dima: We'll check your guess later. But first, what's your language point for the second part of the report Kate? Kate: It's the expression 'to keep a close eye on' meaning to watch closely. Steve says 'built-in cameras will be keeping an especially close eye on all the customers' so his word of warning is, watch out how you behave when you use them. Steve: The machine will dispense a gram of gold for about 40 dollars and a 10 gram bar for just under 350 dollars. But one word of warning. If you put in your money and nothing comes out, don't start banging your fist on this treasure chest, built-in cameras will be keeping an especially close eye on all the customers. Dima: That was our correspondent Steve Rosenberg at a railway station in Berlin. Now, before we talk about the answer to this week's question, do you mind going through some of today's vocabulary again Kate? Kate: Not at all. We began by talking about vending machines, that is machines from which small items such as packaged food or drinks can be bought by inserting money. Because cash is inserted through a slot, they are also known colloquially as slot machines. And another synonym is dispensers. We then mentioned the phrase on the go goodies meaning small things that we buy and consume without stopping, like chocolate bars, crisps and other snacks, for example. And then, the word precious, which means very expensive and valuable. We talked briefly about stocks and shares, which means part of the ownership of a company which people can buy as an investment. And finally, the expression to keep a close eye on, meaning to watch very closely. Dima: Thanks, Kate. Finally, back to our question. Which currency was used in the report to talk about the price of gold? Kate: Well, I said euro, but now I am thinking about again. I think I might have got that wrong. Dima: Yes, and the correct answer was dollar. And that's because like every other major prmotity, gold is prised in dollars. Well, I'm afraid that's all we have time for today. Until next week. Kate: Goodbye!"

Cantonese,"Nov 2 Happy to know you guys. I am a senior three student in Zhixin High School, busy preparing for the coming examinations. I major in chemistry but to be honest, I don't think I am fan of it. In contrast, I find physics more attractive. Living in the school six days a week, Zhixin seems to become my second home, where I live with my friends. Though life there is exhausted, but the graduating year is amazing. I get up at 6.30am usually, and fall into sleep at 11.30pm. God, I spend most of my time on studing and reading. Tired but feeling good. There is one thing that I would like to share with you. The teaching building for senior three has a lift. But the complaint is endless, for continiously, many students or teachers were trapped in it. It broke down with such frequency that none of us was surprised when it broke again. Still, everytime my friends and I use that lift, we are worried. But the school hasn't had a plan to repaired it completely. See you next week. Thank you."

Cantonese,"What's life As I have too much free time being a student librarian, I always think about different endless questions. And the meaning of life is one of my favourite topic to be pondering. 'Live for working or work for living?' is a question raised by my mentee recently. I believe our life should not only be occupied by job. I still believe the meaning of living is awaiting for one's definition, you have to explore the meaning of your existance. Deplorably work for living is a must unless we were born in rich family, otherwise most of us have to put up with our work. When we cannot exclude working from our life, it's really important to have a job that you like, or you have to learn how to adjust yourself to suit the environment. Life is not easy, and nobody said it is easy too. I'm still learning how to accept and adopt the imperfectness of my life."

Cantonese,"The 20th Hong Kong Book Fair I haven't written any diary in here for a long time as I have been quite busy these days. The 20th Hong Kong Book Fair is being held at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. This is a fair which is held in Hong Kong every year. As a book lover, there is no reasons for me not to go there. I really thought I will buy nothing at there at first. But I was wrong indeed. There were so many people go to Book Fair in the past. And the space of the book fair this year is bigger than last year, so it is more comfortable to have shopping. To increase the sales revenue, different publishers has offered an attractive discount for their books. Some of them are really cheap and worth buying it! As a result, I bought nine books at a low price, including English, Chinese and Japanese friction books. Three of them are written by Higashino Keigo, who is a well-known author in Japan. I want to read his book for a long time but didn't have a chance. As I didn't think I will buy anything, I hadn't had so much cash. I am sure I buy a lot more books if I have. Now there are 16 books in my room which I haven't read yet. And I believe I really don't have to buy any more books in this year."

Cantonese,"Ore dressing Ore dressing is the technology of seperating target minerals and nontarget minerals based on the nature of the minerals. According to the differences in category,scale of producton and requirement of quality this technology can derive three forms of realization,that is,by flotation,by proportion and by electromagnetism. The way by flotation is to separate the two materials by taking advantage of their different floatabilities; by proportion is for the reason that they donâ€™t acount for the same percentages;and by electromagnetism is specific to the electromegnetic ore. The source ores for this program are those from Qielieqike mine which contains three main orebodies,i. e. No.1,No.2,and No/3, thereinto, No.1 and No.2 have close grade.

However, unfortunately, my school have no these subject and I hadn't chosen design... And I had chosen to learn science and I am now very regret about it. I had tried to learn very hard in science but I am just cannot work up much enthusiasm and get the good result. I am really lost. What should I do? Should I forget my HKCEE exam and continue my life on my interest, philosophy or design? Or maybe I should forget the difficulties of science and study it for HKCEE? I have no idea about it. Can anyone help me and give me some suggestions?"

Cantonese,"The First day I work in the year of Rabbit Today is the first day I work in the year of Rabbit. Every colleague in our teams seemed to stay at home during the holiday.

Fortunately, they seem nice and helpful, I can feel that they are considerate of me even my English is not as good as them. The way I thank them is to do my job as well as possible. I also received the replies of two application letters of government job. They provide me a opportunity by inviting me to attend their tests. This is great for me as I am dreamed of working for government. The government job is suitable for me and difficult to apply because of many competitors. I will take the chance and try my best in the test. I don't believe in god, but Thank God, anyway."
Cantonese,"Hello! Glad I have found this site and thanks everyone that adding me! Hope I could gain a lot of improvement in languages through exchange and sharing over here. I am a Chinese born and living in a multilingual country - Malaysia. A country majorly populated by Malay, Chinese, Indian and others. The good part of living here is you can easily mingle with different etchnic group and learn their language and culture. The drawback are, you might adapt to the mingling languages or local slang 'lah~ leh~ lo~' which could diminish the beauty of your spoken language. And due to at least 2 - 3 languages we need to speak daily with different people, this cause us couldn't focus and have difficulties to become proficient in one language. Although I'm a Chinese, but I couldn't speak Cantonese as good as a Hongkongese, or speak Mandarin as good as a Taiwanese. Hong Kong films have a lot of influence in our Cantonese learning. For my English, I still need to put tremendous effort to practise my speaking and listening skills. So all brothers and sisters here, please help me out~!"

Cantonese,"After shock Tonight I watched a movie named Aftershock---Tangshan earthquake. It made me aware that one girl's life will change forever after shock,one mother's choice will change her family forever after shock, one memont can change your life forever after shock. It's a moving story, and I really touch about it. Here's the story: Tangshan,1976. Two seven-year-old twin children are buried under the rubble of the the devastating earthquake. The rescue team explains to their mother,Li Yuanni,that freeing either child will almosts certainly result in the death of the other. Forced to make the most difficult decision of her life, she finally chooses to to save her son Fang Da, the male twin. Li Yuanni has no ides that her decision is overheard by her daughter Fang Deng, the female twin. Although she has been left behind as dead, the little girl miraculously survives for several more days before being pulled clear by another rescue team who believe that she is simply a corpse. She wakes up in the pouring rain next to the dead body of her father. Suffering from the emotional shocks of the disaster and the painful memory of her mother's choice, Fang Deng refuses to reveal her identity. She is adopted by a middle-aged Chinese couple and years later moves to Canada to marry. Shadowed by the traumatic experiences of the earthquake and devastated by her mother's decision to abandon her, she continues to be emotionally withdrawn throughout her adult years. Sichuan,2008. 32 years later, when the Sichuan earthquake takes more lives,Fang Deng returns to China as a volunteer with a rescue team. The process of witnessing other people's suffering at the time of a natural disaster helps her to overcome her lown trauma and forgive her mother. She finally reunites with her family after 32 years apart."

The colleague asked me some difficulties in her work and I gave some advices. I feel a sense of satisfaction as I think I could help her regardless of whether the advice work or not. Then I walked along Nathan Road alone and finally went to Science Museum. I have not been there for a long time. The facilities have no change at all but some are added in the museum to attract more visitor. I finally enjoy some facilities which I did not play last time. However, I feel lonely as no one was shared my happiness. Probably it is the right time for me to call some friends who do not contact for a long time."
Cantonese,"life question after watching â€˜scusa ma ti chiamoâ€™ Have you ever imagine fall in love with a girl who is younger than you 20 years old? I am thinking about this question after watching the Italian movie â€˜scusa ma ti chiamoâ€™ (sorry if I love you). Itâ€™s a story describe above a high school girl fall in love with an advertisement creative director who is 20 years older than her. The movie is comedy which can let you relax and laughing. What makes me curious is how many people could accept fall in love with a person who is younger than you. I canâ€™t imagine such scene would happen to me now! That means I am 24 now and I fall in love with a little girl who is only 4 years old! If I am lucky enough, I could be her father! I would say itâ€™s normal if I loved my 4 yrs old daughter, itâ€™s also normal if I say that 4 years old girls are cutie. But itâ€™s really horrible if I fall in love with them! By the way, I think I would fall in love with a 27 years old lady while I am 47 because men always like young and beautiful ladies. Furthermore, I think I canâ€™t afford othersâ€™ discrimination to me if I am serious to this inmate relationship. Although love shouldnâ€™t have any limitation or calculation but nobody can avoid the reality if you want to hold a true, faithful and long experience. I would not choose a difficult and harmful way if I am really stand on her side."

Cantonese,"Assignment--self evaluation In this task my role was Rxxâ€™s Island Sports Foundation (RISF) Board Member and I was on the FOR side. I had worked to raise fund for the project and I supposed that this project would bring prosperity to the island and would create opportunities for the public to enjoy sports. Though I would not say I was the main force in the discussion, however, I did make some contribution to the team. In the issue of transportation, we were considering possible routes for weekday shuttle buses which travel students from schools to the island. In my position, I needed to find out a way to minimize our cost for this extra service. So I suggested 3 stops at Bronx, Rxxâ€™s Island and Queens, respectively, and bus would go back and forward to pick up students from Bronx and Queens via the island. (There is MTA bus service from east Harlem to the island so that thereâ€™s no need for extra service.) In this condition, we would need only one bus on this route and the travel time would be less than half an hour as estimated. And at last we ended up with this method. Then we came to the issue of how to raise fund for the transportation. Someone in the team suggested we can find some grants because the transportation cost would probably exceed the current budget. Since my work was to raise fund for this project, it would be my responsibility to find out more grants or funds suitable for sports and transportation. Though it was not a main issue in the task, I did think this was a good idea so I tried hard to find out some useful grant websites and shared the information to the team. Also I suggested in the future we can hold some activities such as student volunteer project, which could engage students in maintenance work for the fields so that students from different schools could communicate with each other and we could cut some cost as well. But the team was so concentrated in field allocation and transportation issues that they did not show much interest in my suggestion. And at last I gave some suggestion to our presentation rehearsal. In terms of skill improvement, I do feel my English is not good enough. I found sometimes I could not express my idea clearly to the team so that I needed to explain it again, which wasted some time. So maybe I need more practice on my English in order to improve my communication skill. Also, I was not firm enough on my suggestion. Take the volunteer proposition for example, if I would have stick to my position and elaborate the idea clearly, my teammates may adopt it and we could have a new issue. Third, I was not as active as some of my teammates during discussion. I think the reason, besides language as mentioned above, was that I had so much assignment these weeks that I had little time for discussion preparation. Anyway, I will try to say more and be more active in the next task."

Cantonese,"dream PART 1 Last night,i had a dream. The dream started at a strange place that i was locked in a box. It's was halloween that everyone was wearing scary costumes. I walked around and find a old lift that using rope to control. I got in and it began downstair. But there wasn't anything. No wall,no floor but darkness. I tried to get out but i couldn't. Then i went back to the beginning of the dream again. Just like a RPG game that you saved at this place and reload afterward. The second time i had forgotten what had happanned but i had forced to back to the reload spot. The third time i was with my friend cici,who is my best friend,walking around in a theme park that people were celebrating halloween . (Maybe some hongkonger will know that it was the ocean park) We took the elscalator and went upstair. But it suddenly changed into a roller coaster. My friend and I hold each other hand tight in order to balance since this roller coaster had broken rail.(æ–·è»Œ) If we don't care about it ,we will drop into the ocean and die. Although we could got to another part of rail safely, but we couldn't did the second time. We jumped out of the roller coaster with hands seperate and caught a part of rail that no roller coaster will pass. We seeked for help but nobody came. I thought that it seemed that we were safe right that moment but i was wrong. Somebody was taking a gun and shotted us. Luckily we didn't get hurt but my friend dropped into the ocean. I was trying to make the guy focus on me so he will have no time to caught my friend. But it didn't worked. So my friend got killed. I felt heartbreak since she died in front of me. Then i was forced to back to the reload spot again. The forth time cici was with me again(Wasn't it strange?)but i didn't wanted her to get killed agin, so take her to the eslcaltor. I must find out what was happening to us,i must know the truth. But there wasn't anything that time too. So I planned to go upstair. We didn't get bounded in the dark place. I was so happy that i keep talking to cici. There wasn't anyone beside me but i was carrying a warm sweater. I felt her in the darkness but she disappeared right when i could see because of the light. I lost her again. Then i was forced to the spot again. I finally knew that was a dream. But that was not acceptable to me. ""Why this happen to me!Keeping me lost my best friend!"" I got mad that i keep shouting to the box and kicking it hard. ""Why i must dreaming watching my friends dying!"" I began to hit the box with my head,trying to get myself awake. ""Wake up!Wake up!!!!!"" I keep to do that and i ""saw"" a room . But it turned to box again, so I hitted harder. It changed again and again . But I still bounded in this nightmare....... (To be cont')"

Cantonese,"History of Cherry Blossoms in Vancouver Today, I decided to write an entry in English. I'd love to write this in Japanese or French, but because I really want to share the content of this entry with everyone on Lang-8 without comprehension problems, I've decided to write in a language I'm more familiar with. Forgive me! The picture I've attached was taken just outside my house. It's of a blooming cherry tree. I've always wondered why there are so many flowering cherry trees in Vancouver, Canada. After all, they're not native to this region. So, I decided to check this up on the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival website. The address is as follows: http://www.vcbf.ca/history Apparently, we've been planting cherry trees in Vancouver since the 1930s. During that time, the mayors of Kobe and Yokohama presented us with 500 Japanese cherry trees to honour the Japanese Canadians who had served in the First World War. These trees were planted around the Japanese cenotaph in Stanley Park. Prior to planting cherry trees, we had primarily planted large trees which, upon maturation, became quite a problem in many ways. Their roots invaded sewer lines, heaved the sidewalks, and their canopies interfered with utility lines. Thinking that cherry trees were smaller and prettier, we decided to replace the problematic trees with cherries, amongst other ornamental trees. In 1958, we received 300 more cherry trees from the Japanese consul, Muneo Tanabe, as a symbol of the friendship between the two nations. These were planted along Cambie boulevard, between 49th and 33rd Avenues, in Queen Elizabeth Park, and also around the Japanese monument in Stanley Park. Small ornamental trees, including cherries, continue to be popular in planting operations in Vancouver until the 1990s. By that time, 36% of Vancouver street trees were of the Prunus genus, which includes flowering plums and cherries. Today, the emphasis on planting ornamental trees in Vancouver has decreased due to the fact that large trees are needed for their environmental benefits. Currently, the most popular type of cherry trees planted in the city are the Akebono cherries. These trees tend to perform better in our climate and do not present as many cases of root problems as other types of flowering cherries. Are there flowering cherries where you live too?"

Cantonese,"Urgent~ What are the most important qualities of a good son or daughter? How these qualities changed or remained the same over time in your culture? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. Being a good son or daughter is what we are supposed to be. Without our parents we would not be here. They brought us up with unconditional love. They have provided us the best education, the most comfortable life and have spent lots of their precious time with us. While we still do not have the ability to take care of them yet, being a good son or daughter is the only thing we can do to thank our parents. However, what qualities should a good son or daughter have? The answer tends to be subjective and differs from each other. In my opinion, spending time with parents and taking care of them are the most important qualities a good son or daughter should have, especially when they are getting old. Nevertheless, these qualities have undergone great changes over time. In the past, people would go home after work and spend their time with their parents. They would have meals together and chat with each other about their days, such as their work and things happening around them. As time goes by, the working hours have became longer so people can not spend as much time with their parents as before. What is more, people nowadays spend lots of time on playing computer games, singing karaoke, using the Internet, and so on. People have more sources of entertainment than before. Having less time with their parents makes the relationships less close than before. Other than that, the quality of taking care of their parents has also changed over time. In the past, parents relied on their children to take care of them when they became old. But in recent years, parents do not rely on their children to take care of them anymore. They plan their retired life earlier by saving money or making investments. Moreover, the resistance of going to nursing homes has been lower than before. The responsibility of taking care of parents has been left to the nursing homes. To conclude, the aforementioned changes cannot be the excuses for not spending time with our parents. We should spare time for them. Maybe we will lose our leisure time, but they are the only parents we have. If we do not take care of them, their hearts will surely break."

Polish,"A dictionary addict. When I was a student, which was a long long time ago in a far far away land, I had a friend, a fellow student, who was addicted to a dictionary. You could always count on him to have the dictionary somewhere around whenever you needed to look up a word or two. I've ('d?) never seen him with a book - always with the dictionary. And he was reading it as if you would read a book, page by page. Sitting in a library, a canteen, a cafe, a corridor, a park - you name it. What's more, he was reading it on a bus or any other mean of transport - no matter whether public or not. It seems that thanks to this constant human-dictionary connection, he himself became a kind of (a?) walking dictionary. All the other students knew he knew (had known?) all the words they didn't know. We, the other students, were making a bit of innocent fun of his dictionary addiction but you know what, we weren't the ones to laugh last, he was. The dictionary addict became the best student in his year and passed all his exams with flying colours. We were so envious! Well, a wise saying says: he who laughs last laughs longest. I wonder if he's still laughing ;) Thanks for reading my idle chatter. Any comments will be most welcome."

Polish,"Code Milky Green! â€˜The Big Bang Theoryâ€™ at first I thought another silly sitcom, boredom, additionally there has been a hype about this show, people around recommend this to each other. They said: â€˜You must see it. We bet you will enjoy that nerdy showâ€™. I have to admit that I always try to avoid overrated things. So I tried to do it this time. Simply I donâ€™t like doing something because the majority does. But to be honest, I was so curious about that show so I couldnâ€™t resist watching at least first part. Iâ€™ve turned the first episode and suddenly I saw Sheldon and thought: dear god, this is that creepy guy who appeared in â€˜Garden Stateâ€™. I remember he had sexual intercourse with his friendâ€™s mother during he was speaking to her Klingon. Ok, I thought, if that weirdo is there it must be a pretty good show. And I must to say that it is. A love that guys, they were super smart, socially awkward, riddle with obsessive compulsion and a purist about every single piece of geek pop culture. In addition they play off nerd stereotypes, all that things caused that I couldnâ€™t stop watching them. What I like more is all that references to pop culture like movies, comics, and video games that people like me will lap up. I should admit that one of my friends is like Sheldon meets up with Wolowitz. Everybody knows heâ€™s got problems with girls. You know he has to put amount of effort to ask any girl to go out with him, but he pretends he hasnâ€™t, he plays stud, tries to show off and tells us how many girls dating with him. He has difficulties even with getting in touch with girls because he treats them at first as a potential sexual objects. Girls can intuit that he sees in them only tits and consider him as a slimy. It sounds ridiculous I know. On the other hands he likes smarting off. He loves it. You know how annoying could be people who always thought they were the smartest in the world. Sometimes they are real pain in the neck."

Polish,"I'd be gratefull for some help with this text. ; ) This article was written by Holly Kearl, who's leading a blog called 'Stop Street Harassment'. She wrote a book which also deals with this topic. The article is about approaching new people we would like to meet and how to do it correctly. The most important factor is treating other persons with respect. We shouldn't use words like ""baby' or 'honey' because some people may find that offensive. Comments about their appearance are not necessary too. Body language is also very important. If we see that someone doesn't want to talk with us by his/her tone of voice or eye contact we should just leave that person alone. If we are unsure, the best way is to ask if he/she has a time and willingness to talk with us. Approaching new people at a desert and dark area may make them feel uncomfortable and unsafe, especially if we are much older or have friends with us when they are alone. We should avoid these factors and make it clear that our intentions are totally positive. If someone turns us down, we shouldn't curse or insult that person. It's inappropriate and their reactions may have nothing to do with us personally. Some people just want to get to their destination or just enjoy nice weather and air. Society suggests that it is men who should approach women. But they are constantly being told by media, family, peers, that it is OK to be aggressive or to sexually objectify women. So it's really important to let young men know about an appropriate interactions in public. There are some programs that counteract these harmful messages, for example 'The Consensual Project' in Washington. Founder Ben Privot gives workshops on college campuses about how to meet someone properly on the street. The other campaigns are ""One Step Too Far"" in Wales or ""Parivartan"" in India. They try to resolve a problem of street harassment or ""eve teasing"". We all should think about appropriate ways of meeting new people. Public places and streets are good place for that as well, we just need to respect each other and try to make our interaction funny. It's the only way to open the door for further conversations."
Polish,"Procrastination Here is a short story about my own personal battle with procrastination and how I somehow manage to cheat myself to do some work instead of just surfing the internet. On a typical day, I start my working day by checking a few feeds I follow. Trouble is if people have had a productive day I will find every other link interesting and will subsequently dive deep into articles and videos. This has potential to fill my day and kill all productivity. Obviously if I wasn't able to find a way to manage it somehow I would have been long unemployed. 2 tips I can share with everyone who wants to take back the control: 1) Plan your activities ahead. If there's a void in your mind your thoughts will will in it and make you wander until lunchtime. Know what you want to achieve. Divide bigger tasks into smaller chunks to make them seem easy to accomplish 2) Measure your working time. I use pommodoro technique, which requires you to work in 25 minutes sprints and then have 5 minutes compulsory breaks in between. I use a simple piece of software called Focus Booster to do the measurment. Works great provided I can actually be bothered to stick to my own technique!"

Polish,"About learning foreign languages There are some ways for accelerate learning new languages. I've just started using it, so I'll try it and share it with you. -- Tip number 1 -- Associations. This is a easy way for remember new words by making an association between the word that you already know (in your native language or language that you know) and word that you try to remember. Making association means that you connect these two words in one story. For example. I will try to remember Spanish word : ""hombre"" which means ""man"". If I was English native speaker I would make an association by connecting word ""hombre"" with some English word which is similar in spelling or sounds similar to other word. Let's look for word ""hombre"", I can see that it's look like connection of hom(e) and bre(aking), so I'll prepare association by mixing in one story words man, home and breaking. In the result I could imagine man breaking to my home. So in that way I've created simple connection in my mind. It's easy way to remember every word in foreign language. Try it, have fun!"

They deal with variety of subjects ranging from psychology, medicine to physics and astronomy. I find the most interesting those relating to an astronomy and the universe. They are usually 50-60 minutes long and in most cases are divided into 5 parts. Sometimes one can find a film in one part. As I said they are posted on youtube so access is really easy. I've already watched a few of them, and they are amazing. People who play in them are usually PhD or professors. In spite of quite difficult topics, there are usually many scientists and complex experiments behind every concluson they present, they can put these subjects across in an accessible way. They present it in a way which keeps you interested in to the end. After I have watch a few more, I'll try to write about one of them."

Polish,"communication in the age of globalization The communication is mostly understand as the imparting or interchange of thoughts, opinions, or information. Nowadays the people are becoming a information society, where the use and distribution of information is significant in numerous fields of social and economical live. Today, in the of globalization, we need to consider the communication as an international interchange of information and the communication above the borders starts to mean also the intercultural one. I am quite sure that after analyzing the key facts both the protagonists and antagonists of the idea of globalization would admit, that the idea of globalization is getting true. The frequency of human migrations and the increasing number of international travels constitute a proof of rising mobility of inhabitants of the global village. In this situation the intercultural contacts, before reserved for the diplomats and merchants, are becoming the part of the daily life of an average citizen."

Me and my two friends have a little project to work on at the University, but unfortunately we're quite short of ideas and time. We're supposed to write a short essay regarding a question that we raise ourselves, although the topic has to be in the field of American literature from the Native American myths to the Puritan Era We've been thinking about doing something about the relation between the Native American culture and the work of the colonialists, but we're not sure whether or not it will bring us towards any conclusions. I'd be more than happy to talk and discuss these matters with anybody who likes such stuff :). Thank you very much!"
Polish,"Advice fro travellers going to Poland This is my English homework. =.= Advice for Japanese travellers going to Poland The People In general- the Polish are not smiling on the streets, they always complain about everything and love looking back communism when, of course, all things were better. Vast majority pf myths about Polish are true. But please donâ€™t be afraid- Polish people love Japanese. It doesnâ€™t mean, however, they can distinguish you from Chinese or Korean. If you meet a J-enthusiast, be prepared for answering a lot of stupid questions about Naruto, Bleach, Sailor Moon, sushi and best entertainment they ever have: â€˜how to say in Japaneseâ€¦â€™. Cuisine During your trip in Poland you will find a lot of odd food. Strange-looking, hot and spicy cabbage eaten with plums and bread, gyÅza stuffed with potatoes and white cheese called pierogi and may many more. And nothing Polish would look like rice. On the other hand the new national meals of Poland are sushi and kebab, 5 sushi bars in one street is enough, and you will meet the most snobbish society in this country. Culture The most important thing to know about is the fact that Chopin came from Poland. And it is not a stupid joke. Another aspect about Polish culture you should know: the national epic of Poland was written in Paris and starts with words â€˜Lithuania, my country!â€™."

Polish,"Blue colored destiny (begining of a story) I always dreamed about writing a novel. Anyway, I decided to write a short romantic story in English. I't just few sentences but I will appreciate your opinion :-) ""Sometimes I wonder if there is something like a destiny. Do we all have paths that are unconsciously taken by our minds? Or, maybe only some people, the chosen ones, are able to make a set of choices, which should be made, if one wants to follow the red string of destiny, instead of cutting it or being entwined with it, to the point of suffocation. If destiny exists, I would like to have one colored light blue, like the vast sky, crossed only with some soft, candy floss looking and nacreous clouds, which will remind me about the existence of wind. Maybe my life would be boring, unlike the beings with red and orange colored destinies, I wonâ€™t be able to warm other peopleâ€™s souls. But, unlike wanting to ignite passion, I would be content with giving peace and tranquility to those who surround me. Lust and passion cannot be understood, and they can only give some fleeting happiness. Living without them is easier, more productive and pragmatic. Or so were my thoughts before I met that person."""

Polish,"What time is it? Since ancient times people has been trying to measure the time. At first they observed the sky and watching stars moving on it they could determine for instance when year seasons start or that the year have 365 days. This way has been in use for a very long time, but as a technology has developed, it appeared that more precise ways of measuring time are required. It was also discovered, that the Earth doesn't necessarily spin around at steady pace. Wind pushing over mountains and influence of the Moon can slow it down or hasten it a little. It is a matter of miliseconds, but for some reason which now I can't remember it was unacceptable. Still looking at stars, examinig them, it was discovered that stars emit light which reach the Earth in even intervals. This discovery created an opportunity of measuring time in the more exact way than ever before... to be continued"

From alternative rock through rap rock to alternative metal. As the show started I got a bit excited. The first song which was sung is called 'Breaking the habit'. It was amazing experience! When Chester (vocalist) stopped singing in the middle of the song, I could hear funs singing very loud. The only thing I was not really happy about was the length of the show. It was too short!

Polish,"Living on your own account? Hi guys, I've got something different this time, no more stupid babbling about my past week, I've written few simple words on the topic I found in my Student Book. Do you think it is a good idea to leave home and live independently when you go to the university or college? In my opinion it's a great idea but it depends on many factors. It for example depends on what kind of person you are, what do you expect from your life, ff you like to live comfortably with your parents, do not worry about money or anything else. When you live in your family home you can be sure that you will have your clothes washed and your hot meals will be prepared. It also depends on how much money do you or your parents have, because it's much more cheap when you stay at home, don't live intependently. They could simply don't be able to afford your ""independency"". When you're studying at the university or in the college you'll propably not have much time to work, to be able to afford living on your own account. Of course I'm sure that is a great experience to get, I think it let you to learn how to take care of yourself, responsibility for yourself and the others. It teach you how to organize your life and your closest surround. I would choose leaving home and living independently if I had the opportunities for that. I've had to go to work pretty soon, but it was only my choice.

Polish,"An anniversary of tragic Crash of pesidential aircraft... Yesterday was an anniversary of a Presidential aircraft crash. Exactly a year ago (on 10th April 2010 ) a Tupolev Tu-154M aircraft of the Polish Air Force crashed near the city of SmoleÅ„sk, Russia, killing 96 people on board. Including the Polish president Lech KaczyÅ„ski and his wife , the chief of the Polish General Staff and other senior Polish military officers, the president of the National Bank of Poland, Poland's deputy foreign minister, Polish government officials, 12 members of the Polish parliament, senior members of the Polish clergy, and relatives of victims of the KatyÅ„ massacre. They were en route from Warsaw to attend an event marking the 70th anniversary of the genocide in KatyÅ„ Forest. The pilots attempted to land at SmoleÅ„sk North Airport but because of the thick fog that reduced visibility they had troubles with landing. Pilots of Polish aircraft were misinformed so that the aircraft was too low as it approached the runway. The aircraft struck trees, rolled upside down and broke apart killing everyone on board... It is very sad that a year has passed and present Polish government actually didnâ€™t do anything (or done not much) to get back wreck of the aircraft from Russia to Poland (even there were some problem with burial of victims). And an average Polish person rather do not know much details about under what circumstances they died because officially Polish government has not yet published its report about it. And Russians rather doesnâ€™t seem to help us in establishing the details.. And it is even more sad that this year on the 1st anniversary of this disaster Russians secretly exchanged boards in SmoleÅ„sk for new one with that difference that they omitted to mention these words I quote disaster victims died on the way to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Soviet genocide in KatyÅ„ Forest. Unquote. (After so many years Russian government doesnâ€™t want to confess to genocide in KatyÅ„ Forest and plead guilty about it...) So.. now the board looks like this : http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/4/9404/z9404504X.jpg Here you can see what have left after this crash: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec_UHl6GNgs&NR=1&feature=fvwp"

Polish,"Some people believe that our modern lifestyle is very unhealthy. However we tend to live longer than we lived a hundred years ago. How would you explain that? I'm sorry for the length.. it should be about 150-200 word, but it's 304.. It's an essay that I wrote at 2 am for my english classes. :) ""Some people believe that our modern lifestyle is very unhealthy. However we tend to live longer than we lived a hundred years ago. How would you explain that?"" Every generation has it own lifestyle. I cannot say that nowadays people live healthier than in the past and that is why I agree just up to the point. To begin with I will write about the main aspect of our lives and that is what we eat. The fact that we live longer and longer does not mean that we rather choose â€™real foodâ€™ to very popular fast food. There is a little bit of the truth in that, but I think it is a result of the place where we live and our modern medicine. For instance in medieval people had worked physical which had a strong injury in their health. Their lives was based only on working for somebody and meeting two ends together. People did not have an acces to the medicine as we have nowadays. They were tired, ill and of course were living shorter then we live now because we have easier and less stressful jobs. The second, we cannot say that people stick to only one lifestyle. There are some who spend whole life sitting in front of TV or computer and some who like active life. They are doing the sports, hanging out with friends and working on their skills. Also our characteristics have a influent in how long we live. Somebody who is confident and others do not make him being stressed will probably live longer then a solitary person who is afraid of everything he or she has to struggle in life. I think that saying how unhealthy out lifestyle is, might be wrong because everybody has it own way of living and of course a free will. The only thing we can do is teaching kids in schools and making the campaigns about healthy life."

Polish,"Why two weddings are better? (and this is not going to be about divorces or polygamy) ;) Nowadays starting a family is very difficult. Young couples very often don't have enough money to buy own flat. Wedding party is it also very expensive. In Poland organization of this type of event (for 80 people) cost even tenfold average Polish month salary! You may think, that 80 people is very much. I thought so too before I tried create my list of guests. Believe me, 80 in this case means something about 20! You have to remember, that your spouse also want to invite some guests. But a 40 is still not a 20, so where is a catch? There is a good practice, to invite not only person, with you want to meet on your party, but also accompanying of this person. This mean that if you want to invite 5 co-workers and 7 friends from student days, you have to be prepared for 24 people in fact. 16 invitations left, but parents, grandparents, family of uncle Bobby, family of uncle John and couple of neighbors, can easily run out this limit. A limit for number of invitations is very difficult to adjust. But you don't have to choose between your friends and a loan. In my case double wedding solves everything :) Let my explain. In catholic culture marriage should be established in the church at front of the God. However, law requires only a civil marriage, which can be established in registry office. Catholic marriage can be simultaneously a civil marriage, but it don't have to :) So, this is our schedule of weddings: 30th April - civil marriage 25th August - catholic marriage Party after civil wedding is going to be mostly for co-workers and friends. It will be in music club like this: http://www.antidotum.wroc.pl/taxonomy/term/6 . On the other hand, party after catholic wedding is going to be mostly for family and few friends (the best ones ;) ) It will be in: http://www.casanuova.pl/wesela/index1.php?id=galeria3 As you can guess, party in a music club is less expensive. That is my idea for our worries :) -------------------------------------------------------- I have a request for you. After reading this entry, please rate my English skills (in 1-10 scale, where 10 means average native speaker) in these categories: correctness of grammar = ? complexity of words used = ? proper tenses = ? interest = ? :)"
Polish,"Place for fire Tomorrow will be end of the year of school, so my classes planed to organse a fire, grilling cabbages - party at the fire. We wanted to organise in a forest near my house, there was benches from previous fire-party. I didn't even suspect that somebody could brake benches, destroy my work. I and myfriend had prepared those branches for previous fire-party. The fire-party had been great. I'll never forget about that time. In June somebody broke benches, I suspect it was third class from my school. Problem is that girls doesn't want to go 2km further to new place for party-fire. This place was prepared by others, we didn't used this place, because on spring there is wet, but on summer this place is good. Sadly is that in Poland destruction work for everybody, public property is daily."

Polish,"Eastern Eastern in poland its time to spend time with family . People visit their relatives and eat together meals. For a lot of poles eastern begins on Munday Thursday. People go then to the church and confess. But the most important days of entire Eastern for everone its Saturday and Sunday On Saturady almost in every polish home people pull ot baskets from cupboards and decorate it by bilberry. A lot of people also decorate their baskets by small yellow chicken toys. After that, we put into our baskets food eg. bread , butter, a lot kind of meats, and of course eggs-boiled egg . Eggs are the most important part in entire basket. They are a symbol of new life and commemorate the Resurrection oj Jesus. People in Poland decorate eggs, before they put it into baskets. They paint it, draw flowers on it, give eggs nice colours. It looks really nice. When baskets are ready, people take it and go to the Church. In church priest conducts short service and consecrates the food ( which are in baskets). Then people can back home, but a lot of them , stay in church and pray. After the visit in church, baskets are putted on into fridge and they are waiting to the next day. On Sunday usually entire family get up earlier and eat cibsecrated food. During the breakfast they share on eggs ( this consecrated one). They should share... but this tradition is being disappeared. After this meal , people ususally go to other relatives in order to share on eggs with them or just talk. The last day of Eastern in Poland is ( i think ) the most amired by kids. It is Monday and its called Åšmigus dyngus. On this day people pour in water each other. You can be pour in water by somebody, even you dont really know this person. On Smigus dyngus is a lot of children on the streets with bottles of water and full big buckets. And roads are really wet then. This game was a symbol of purfication, but now it is just a fun play."
Polish,"to swear' If I'm not mistaken, the verb 'to swear' has two meanings. I'm pretty sure you all know what I mean, but just to make things clear, let me remind you that it either means to make a solemn promise or (to?) use offensive language. I've always found it amusing that the same word can have a positive and a negative meaning at the same time. Somehow, it suggests the positive swearing and the negative swearing have something in common. Polish, my mother tongue, has two words for the two mentioned meanings. We use the verb ""klÄ…Ä‡"" to speak of using offensive language and the verb ""przysiÄ…c"" is used when speaking of making promises. On the second thought, there is an expression in Old Polish which seems to confirm the speculation of (an) intertwined nature of the two meanings of swearing. Although it would sound old-fashioned a Pole could say: KlnÄ™ siÄ™ na wszystkie Å›wiÄ™toÅ›ci, Å¼e mÃ³wiÄ™ prawdÄ™. (I swear by all that is sacred that I'm telling the truth.) - using the same verb which they would choose to describe someone using swear words. Strange."

The Google+ chat is nothing other than GTalk, available also in GMail (anyway it's great solution). The Photos bookmark in my profile links to my photos on PicasaWeb (also great solution, especially because I use Picasa Desktop on Windows). I really don't know why Google didn't decide to link YouTube account to profile as Movies bookmark. What is more, the +1 engine works like your own digg. com. You can browse the search results in Google Search and mark some websites as +1. All of them will be shown in your +1 bookmark in your profile.

Polish,"The film I really want to watch Today Iâ€™m going to watch a film titled â€˜Green Mileâ€™. This film is an adaptation of the book written by Stephen King. Iâ€™ve read â€˜Green Mileâ€™ recently and I find itâ€™s excellent. Kingâ€™s writing style is very specific, he fantastically builds an atmosphere of terror. His books are long, but he uses to build his characters from scratch, creating his tempers very carefully and little by little, and it makes them very real. He overmastered creating heroes to a fare-thee-well. He carved out his own, personal, urepeatable writing style. I think it must be very hard to adapt his books and itâ€™s a big challenge for moviemakers to do it well. Iâ€™m very curious of this film."
Polish,"Wednesday-almost good day ;p Well... Today how everyday I got up in the morning, exactly at half past six o'clock.

Polish,"Harry Potter - My first English-language book. Hi, Today I'd like to share with my experiences which refer to reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. I've already read only 7 chapters but I must admit that reading it in oreginal version is something special. When reading it, I have to focus on the text as twice as normally consequently, I comprehend, and spot an great amount of details in comparishion with the first time I read this in my mother language. Firstly, I was detered by enormousness of vocabulary I'd not known, then I listened to advice of my friend to give a try, at least for 30 days, He said ""If you don't like it I will help you burn this damp book presonally, but give a shot"" and that inclined me to try. Then, work began. It was hard at first but I relised that full comprehension of text (every single word) gives pleasure of reading. It stimulate your imagination to picture wverything in your head and definitely (if the book is good) enchant the reader. H. Potter is beyond doubt that type of book. Learning by heart so many words is tough but the key here is determination. I can assure those who are not into reading books in other languages that the learning vocabulary cannot be compared with learning in school. You're doing it in your own pace and whenever you have time so only feeling that accompany learning is pleasure and complacency. Many words are repeated in book so if you learn it once on the beginning, you will not forget it easily. That's all for today. Greetings :)"
Polish,"Specyfying my language goal. Hi! As some of you can remember from my very first post, I have a language goal. It's following: to speak American English fluently with strong accent until this year ends. (By the way - do you know any better way to say 'until this year ends'? I would be glad if you could write some in comment.) Today, I specified it. Now, it sounds like this: to speak American English fluently with strong accent and to pass CPE exam in the last term in this year. It's now much better, because it gives me a lot of pressure to learn English even more hard than I've learned before. I am going to do something I call 'total immersion in English', what means that I am going to use it all time when I can. What do you think about my language goal actualization? ;>"
Polish,"My opinion on islamization of Europe Islamization of Western Europe is a very controversial issue. Every year thousands of immigrants from the Africa and the Near East move to the Europe. They cause a lot of problems such as robberies, assaults and murders. They usually don't work, so they get social benefits (e. g. child benefits, unemployment benefits etc.). Immigrants often create ghettos in suburbs. Most of them are Muslims. There are more and more mosques for instance in the Paris or London. This situation is a result of multiculturalism policy. I think that governments of Western Europe made serious mistake giving immigrants the green light. I hope that european politicians will recognise threats of immigration and they will start to do something. I am not prejudiced against Muslims but I want to tell that the menace of Islamic Europe is very real. European values such as freedom, christian civilization or respect to women can not to survive. Killing spree of Andres Breivik in Norway should suprise no one. His act of terrorism is a very dangerous manifestation of animosity towards left-wing politicians who support the immigration. And what do you think on Muslim immigrants?"
Polish,"City Center. Good day to you, I've just came back from my hometown's center. I was buying small gifts for my grandmother and grandfather.

It has a population of 70,000 people but it's a peaceful, lovely piece of Earth. It calls Gniezno. Historians says that Gniezno is a first, legendary capital of Poland. In the center stays Romanesque/Gothic cathedral. There are also restaurants and cafes. We have a spacious promenade too. My favourite place is ""Ratuszowa Restaurant"" which means ""Town Hall Restaurant"". I can drink there the best cold caffee in my town. It's perfect, believe me! Have a nice day!"
Polish,"Message in a Movie The next article,which Iâ€™ve recently read, is titled â€˜Message in a Movieâ€™. This is a summary. It has long been tempted to link Roman Polanskiâ€™s films to the directorâ€™s private life. The 'Ghost Writer', which is the artistâ€™s latest film, is no exception. The political thriller, based on a novel by Robert Harris, follows a ghost writer hired by former British prime minister Adam Lang to draft his memoirs. The Tony-Blair-inspired Lang is indicated by The International Criminal Court for war crimes in Iraq. The writer slowly reveals a conspiracy. For most of the rest of the film, they remain holed up at the beach house- not unlike Polanski, who was under house arrest in a Swiss resort, as he finishes his work. In one scene near the movieâ€™s start, itâ€™s impossible to miss the echo when Langâ€™s lawyer advises him not to return home for fear of arrest at the airport upon his arrival. Polanski was arrested just after he landed at Zurich airport. The author of the article claims that it was a bit of mystery why the Swiss arrested him then. In the middle of postproduction, Polanski suddenly found himself in a prison and he continued to work in his cell. Now Polanski has to wear an electronic bracelet to keep him from absconding to France, where he might avert from extradition. In the film, neither Lang nor his ghost writer can escape their pursuers. The author of the article asked how Polanskiâ€™s thriller illuminates his own legal case. Whether life imitates art to the end remains to be seen. Nina"

Polish,"Could you read and correct? In Poland 52% of Polish students begin work on the first year, or even before. . The high costs associated with studios, particularly for learners outside the place of his residence, one of the reasons to combine learning with work. The most aggravating for student budgets are expenses associated with renting a flat payment of tuition and travel to their home village. Next, the students spend money on entertainment, postpone the vacation and electronic equipment such as laptops and portable music players. students should find this work so as not to interfere with studies. Finding jobs for young people becomes independent financially. In Poland you can start working after completing the age of sixteen. more and more teenagers take to work in the holidays. They want to earn their own needs and pleasures. Work is no dimension of students not merely financial, but also shows how seriously the young man takes his career. The desire to gain new experience, willingness to work."
Polish,"Noble Mistake (story) Attention: this story is written in an unordinary style, please don't crticise it. I'm posting it here to get corrections not critics. And it contains some boyxboy issue so if it offens you, just quit reading :) ** He sent him an SMS. First Second. Seventhâ€¦ Fifteenthâ€¦.. He stopped counting. He didnâ€™t even want to know how many times he phoned him. Numbers have lost their sense. It could be one as well as ninety-nine. It could last one hour as well as three seconds or days. The only question was whyâ€¦ Why was he doing this? He met this immature brat few times before. They yelled, argued, theyâ€™ve almost killed each other. And then after many years (yeah â€˜manyâ€™ was the only number making any sense at the momentâ€¦ but was â€˜manyâ€™ a number?) After so many years he saw him on the street. Stronger but lonely. Smiling but sad. He didnâ€™t know why but he felt like giving him a hand. A helpful one. And he didâ€¦ They went to the cafÃ©. Just like that, like the past was nothing. Because they didnâ€™t mind the past. They were interested in present. One of them was afraid of future and one of them wasnâ€™t afraid of anything. One of them was still fighting and the other one has lost long time agoâ€¦ They talked like old friends; drinking some coffee and eating chocolate muffins. Because chocolate is our best friend. It will always make us smile and will never disappoint us. This is the friend everyone dreams about and nobody knows about. But he knew. And he wanted to help him. So he gave him chocolate. And it helped. And he was grateful. He needed a person to talk to. He needed to say this. To shout this. He wanted to share his thoughts with whole world. But he couldnâ€™t. It wasnâ€™t what others wanted to hear. They only wanted to know heâ€™s fine. So he said he was fine. Why not? If it made their lives easier. One less problem was very comfortable for them. It was comfortable thinking everythingâ€™s fine. And what if it wasnâ€™t? Who knewâ€¦ He knew. He told him everything. Every single sorrow, every single phantom of the past and the future. And then he wondered if giving him this hand was a right choice. He didnâ€™t know. What happened later remains a mystery. He didnâ€™t notice leaving the cafÃ©. He didnâ€™t notice getting drunkâ€¦ He only noticed waking up the next day in a hotel room, horrible headache and faint scent of pansiesâ€¦ The scent he will never forget. He had a feeling something wrong has happened. Something wrong but also something greatâ€¦ Noble. And he wanted to rememberâ€¦ but he couldnâ€™t. And then he said to himself he will never drink againâ€¦ Never drink again without him, he added after a while. He ignored the headache and got up. He almost fall down. But tried his best and stood up. He looked around, looked through the window, looked into the fridge. And he only found a little piece of pink stick-in paper with a phone number. And now heâ€™s been swearing at this little paper. Why the hell did he take it?! He should have left it where heâ€™d found it and forget about this event. Just like always. But he didnâ€™t. He took it, saved number and tried to contact him now. Was he getting old? ** Heâ€™s been sitting on the couch watching his cellâ€™s display. It was vibrating all the time announcing new messages. First message Second message. Seventhâ€¦ Fifteenthâ€¦.. It was a lot, but the phone kept vibrating. He didnâ€™t want to count anymore. He felt guilty enough. Why did he agree for that? Was he that desperate?! To open his heart to him? Maybe it was too much already. He hated politics, he hated economics, he hated all of the issuesâ€¦ Sometimes he dreamt about leaving this corrupted country and disappearing for a weekâ€¦ monthâ€¦ yearâ€¦ Whole life maybe. Why not? Would anybody notice? Or would they go on without him? Yeah, he wouldnâ€™t be surprised. Day-dreaming was his favorite activity lately. He could finally run away from this gray reality. He could do anything â€“ swim, sleep, visit, rest, relaxâ€¦ The phone stopped. Why? Lack of moneyâ€¦ or intentions? It made him sadâ€¦ More than he already was. He shouldnâ€™t mindâ€¦. But he did. He tried to remember what happened last day: Heâ€™s been walking on the street, wearing his everyday mask of smiling idiot. Everybody get fooledâ€¦ except of him. He met his glance and knew that he knew. Butâ€¦ Why him? He was the one he hated the most. He fought and then humiliated him. And then the roles changed. He didnâ€™t regret the past but, in fact, didnâ€™t mind it now. He had other, more up to date problems. Heâ€™s seen extended hand. His hand. He shook it. And their conflict was over. They went to the cafÃ©. And talked. He talked actually. He felt like throwing this out of his mind. And he let him talk. Heâ€™s been listening with interest. With understanding. And he felt like spending more time with him. Like drinking and singing and shouting and laughing and having fun together. For the first time for many years he felt something warm inside. And then he woke up. The dream has finishedâ€¦ Was it a bad dream? A good dream? A nightmare? He looked aroundâ€¦ Was it a dream?! He was next to him. Looking so different in a sleep. So innocent. So unlike himself. Soâ€¦ He sighed. He had to go. He didnâ€™t feel what he felt last day. He made a mistakeâ€¦. He left the room and came back home. But he left somethingâ€¦ Heâ€™s left another mistake. Now, sitting on the couch, he turned the mobile off. Vibrating was too distracting, he had to think a littleâ€¦ ** Thanks for reading, hope you enoiyed :)"

Polish,"Franz Kafka - Process Process was made by a famous Austrian writer â€“ Franz Kafka, who was not appreciated in his times, unfortunately. It's a quite simple story which takes place in some unknown big city in XX century. Those informations however are not necessary. We had better focus on personality of JÃ³zef K. who is a main character. What led him to dreadful consequences was his harmful attitude for life. JÃ³zef K. was celebrating his 30 birthday when two wardens entered his room saying he is being arrested, without a cause. That's how the absurd and terror starts to mingle. JÃ³zef K. visits many of ignorant and unqualified judges just to find a pornographic magazines in place of penal codes. We can observe gradually change of main character â€“ from confusion and rebel to completely giving up. An unbelievably climax is murder of JÃ³zef K. The whole story has got a figurative pronunciation. We are somehow arrested and enslaved by a inevitable death and consumptional style of life. There's no chance for making any togetherness. That's how ended up lonely egoist focusing only on success. The strong point of the novel is skillful using language â€“ onirisme and terror makes an unusual atmosphere. The plot is quite dynamic and a reader really can feel like JÃ³zef. Millions ways of interpretations makes the novel still actual. I can thoroughly recommend it to everyone who likes psychological topics with a pint of philosophy. Who knows, maybe it would change your life?"

Polish,"Contrast higher and lower education (in Poland) In May, this year high school graduates in Poland have final tests. Their grades will decide if they can apply to higher education. Many of them do not even know yet what higher education is and how does it differ from lower education. I want to focus on discrepancies. There are three main differences between higher and lower education. These are choice, the scope of material and qualifications. Firstly, I want to take into consideration a matter of choice. As probably most of people know, lower education, on the contrary to higher education, is compulsory. Our law states, that till we reach the age of eighteen we have to continue education on lower degree. After that time we can leave off education because higher education is just a matter of our choice. After high school we decide if want to continue our education or not, whereas while starting lower education we do not have choice like this. The second difference is the scope of material. During time spent in lower educationâ€™s institutions students have to master very general material, whereas higher education offers more concrete knowledge. That is so because lower education, I can say, prepares people to everyday life. Knowledge offered by this kind of education is obligatory for every person. Conversely, knowledge, we possess during studying on higher educationâ€™s institutions, is focused on one particular course, that we are interested in. The third thing is connected with qualifications. People tend to think that lower education does not offer us concrete knowledge. By deduction, it does not give us any qualifications to do some particular job. As opposed to lower education, higher education gives us opportunity to be specialized in one subject (of course only if we end our studies). The reason why people choose to study few more years is the gulf between possibilities to be an expert after lower and higher education. To sum up, there are far more differences between higher and lower education. Choice, the scope of material and qualifications just highlight a number of other differences that left to discuss. They should be took into consideration by this future student while deciding: to start higher education or not."

Whispering and throwing out single words was making me angry, but I was too weak to by angry. Unfortunately my mom is also ill, so we both are sitting at home since Wednesday.

Polish,"An entry about... nothing. Check it out. Yes, my dear friends, I have a typical for all writers disease - lack of subjects to write. Complete lack of ideas. How do I usually manage with that? I try to write something. Anything. It can be a post about nothing, which I am (let's be honest) writing today, it can be just the first thing which will come into my mind. So, I thought it won't be the worst idea ever to write that kind of post today. It's much better than to write nothing. You can try this method too. Believe me or not, writing a boring post will help you to get fluent in your target language as same (if somebody will read it) as writing very interesting post. P. S. Because of that nobody answered my question from the previous post, I will ask it once again - how to end a post in American English?"

Polish,"How to not kill your orchid. I am a happy owner of two orchids. Happy because they are still alive. The first one has white flowers and the second one has dark pink flowers. They are really fit and beautiful plants and when they bloom I am enchanted with them. Both my orchids have already finished blossoming. Orchids have a very sensitive to humidity roots. If you water them to often the roots will rot and the plant will fade. The proper watering frequency is every 7 to 14 days. In order to determine if the watering time has come you need to check the colour of roots. If they are dark green it means the plant don't need watering. When they become silver it means you can water your orchid. There is a special way of watering. You don't just use watering can but you must dip the pot in the bucket of water for 20 minutes, because the roots must be irrigated evenly. After this time you have to drain off the pot carefully so that the roots don't stay submerged in water. To do this you can stand the pot on the granulate with hygroscopic properties."

Polish,"National Stereotypes Stereotypes in short are kind of 'opinions' we made about something, basing only on rumors, gossips, opinions from other people etc. They are also constant, which means - they doesn't change even if are different than reality. One of the popular polish stereotypes is that it always rains in London. So if there is sunny - nobody says a word, but when it's raining indeed ""See? A told you!"" phrase can be heard. Today I'd like to write about national stereotyping. In other words: what people of one nation thinks about others. Some of them might be funny, other sad or cruel. If anybody will feel insulted - I'm sorry. Please keep in mind that those opinions are the most frequent but doesn't represent the whole Poland. These are stereotypes ONLY! Germans - Germans are well known of being rich and having very colorful clothes (especially during winter). Although every German has his own car, they used to travel using trekking sticks. They are pretty liked in Poland, however sometimes are still connected with World War II or medieval events. (We used to have wars many many times in past.) German little boys always have long, blond, curly hair and likes football. Russians - Known as greatest brothers and comrades of Poles. We sing together, drink together, fight together and die together. Despite cruel history, they are still considered as best friends. Czech - Not much about them. They talks funny, and when you have trouble you can be sure that they will be first.. to flee. Liked. Norwegian and Finnish - Even more richer and colorful that Germans and our greatest rivals in Sky Jumping also. Highly advanced technologically. All of them listen to Heavy Metal and have long hair or beard. Most beautiful women. Ukrainians - Cossacks. Bohun tribe. Same as Russian but tougher. Liked by women. Italians - They likes to talk a a lot and fight each other. Occasionally slave some polish workers. Liked though. Spanish and Greek - Most handsome. Beloved by women. French - Because of WW2 events not very liked and known as.. well.. cowards and traitors. A little arrogant as well. English, Irish and Scottish - Similar to France. Also know of being a little.. anemic. This stereotype evolves fast though, because of current migration-boom. They slowly becomes to be ""almost-like-normal"". They are mostly liked. United States Americans - Well, that's a hard one. American white people are generally not liked in Poland, and considered overweighted, arrogant and poorly educated. They are also known as barbarians, who doesn't respect other cultures and thinks that all problems can be solved by Fists, Fire, and F22. Black people who represents ""gangsta style"" ale beloved by polish Hip Hop fans (youth mostly) though. Famous 'Americans Scientists' are also known of doing research of everything that exist. Chinese - Extremely well organized, working like ants. Having good food and funny smiles. Oddly not so liked. Japanese - Chinese who got robots, anime, and katanas. Japanese tourist always makes A LOT of photos, points things with their fingers and are always smiled. I think that would be all for now :) And as I said before - if ANYBODY feel insulted - I'm truly sorry. No offense please."

Polish,"The week-long frustration Sometimes I hate the approach of surrounding me people to my education. I plan to go at the university to study medicine and to become a doctor, and I have got really big chances to accomplish that particular intention. My class share my interests or dream about academic career. My high school is one of the best twenty high schools in Poland, so over 50% of my friends will fulfil their hope. Nevertheless, my Polish teacher cannot understand that I spend 8 hours at school daily, then I have to waste over 3 hours to arrive to and return from school, as I live 20km from the capitol - and trains are so crowded that there is no place to take out a notebook or textbook and learn, which gives 11 hours daily in total, then I have to sleep at least for 6 hours - I tried to sleep only 4, but on Fridays' afternoons I used to not notice cars and other lethal objects. It makes 17 hours daily. There lasts 24 - 17 = 7 hours, but I have to take a shower 'sometimes', wash hair 'sometimes', change clothes 'sometimes', eat at least 1800 kcal daily to survive and you must agree with me that doing these things is obligatory at least once a day, and it would be a pleasure to eat three times. It takes 3 hours (I'm a girl and I have some needs, I wouldn't be able to bear being dirty, would I.)So, for my studies I have got now 4 hours. Pretty much of time? Forget it! 2 hours takes homework, and I have 2 pets and a psychic construction which refuse to have less than 15 minutes of relax a day. All in all, I have got as much as 1-2 hours to expand my knowledge, study for ALL exams in next week - lately, 3 exams from different subjects (I have to constantly divide my attention between unconnected sections of education, and as there is 1 up to 3 hours from every among 13, it all ends in learning definitions by heart from bad-written textbook (we have a class game - who finds more errors and misleading fallacies in current chapter. I have got 15 points). What's the meaning behind forcing intelligent people to do something that they hate and to which they resist when the same effect might have been obtained in a more pleasure and cheaper way, where students would not forget all the definitions a moment after graduation? Arranging the time for the future Polish doctors, scientist, journalists, lawyers, programmers, academic lecturers, architects, economists, politicians to hinder them from getting real knowledge and to not allow them walking 'at large'? I would like to have time for anatomy, physiology, pharmacy, physics, chemistry an biology studies, because all of them will build up my future career. I dream about taking a part in a national biology contest, but now there is no chance that I will prepare for it properly. My Polish teacher devised that students will make in group of fours presentations about our obligatory reading. First of all, there will be maximally 20% of people who will read original instead of concise description. No one has time. Secondly, we must search for materials in university libraries, and remember that we are future scientist and doctors, not writers or journalists. We also don't have a time for it. Afterwards, it does not cultivate proper writing nor critical thinking nor cooperation, because we have official bibliography and the only one way of getting positive mark is agreeing with statements contained in Polish literature professors' essays. We don't have a time to copy somebody's else theses. Moreover, every hour spent on this wonderful developing activity is one hour less spent on Biology/Chemistry/Maths/Physics. We have only thirteen months to our final exams which results are essential for applying to university. Every 1% less on this 'matura' exam may lead to situation when there will be someone better than you on the list of fresh students. Everyone has to take exam from Polish (in fact, it's the history of world and national literature with obligatory guessing what might the person making the test want as an answer, as the questions are always vague), English (in Poland other foreign languages are being taught so poorly that almost nobody decides to pass French, German or Russian), Maths on the basic level, all of them only to get minimum 30% and the subjects which are chosen for enrolment and which are important in counting 'points' for university; for us they are expanded levels of Maths, Biology, Physics and Chemistry. Do not even compare it with SATs - they are 'way beyond' them in memorization datas which can be too easily found in special tables. We don't have a time to waste on something which must be taken on only 30% level when expanded things must be passed over 95%. Furthermore, we are young and we need rest. We work until the small hours, writing the text of speeches, making slides and finding quotations and creatively agreeing with authorities. We still grow and working to 1, 2 or 3 o'clock and getting up at 5.30 or 6.00 (no one lives near school, you see, everyone are commuting) is sicked. How can we be productive on important lessons? During day we prefer to do our homework and prepare to the following day. We don't have a time. It is not the first time when such a situation occurs. We cannot just not do this presentation, because the teacher will take umbrage at it (I haven't mistaken the expression, she will really take an offence!) and you will get lower marks from all tests and essays. School regulations? A bunch of printed paper. Student council? Important only at school's feasts. Courts? So, they don't not really work in Poland, the repudiation to your petition would be announced to your grandchildren. Media? Just a joke, they don't have interest in such insignificant affairs, of course until someone's suicide would be convenient for their patron political party. Headmistress? She will say that we must settle it ourselves. It's a normal live in my country: don't seek for justice, there isn't a gram of it between borders. In fact, giving us such a stupid work is an example of malevolence and is in theory forbidden. What do you think is better? A young person who studies a lot about human anatomy and then becomes a good, renowned or just conscientious specialist, or a young person who waste times on making a lecture about some book of some author who is TOTALLY UNKNOWN outside Poland (so he is not so much important, is it) and then wastes his time, angry and frustrated, short before exams and who achieves nothing he has planned before? My country needs scientists, but there are no important contest from scientific subjects which are being awarded with scholarship or money and which are just challenging and enticing students to study more. No, there are always contest for best ugly children blobs and blots, best naive school composition, best plain recitation of poems acted dull and boring as hell or best naive project based on babbling something about how the local history is important, with mixed dates and false conclusions repeated after teacher. If someone really wants to help Poland, he must realise that only the chosen, endowed and talented kids who have read a lot of books and have written reams of texts have the chance to become real erudite persons, humanists. Choosing path of humanistic subjects only because someone doesn't want to learn Maths is more stupid than, for example, getting some important for society occupation like baker. Bakers are truly important and undervalued - they can make really good wholemeal bread and thus lower the rate of colon cancer among citizens, provide important vitamins in their products and so on. For the other hand, someone who have spent 3 years on studying willy-nilly humanistic subjects in high school, taken exams and gone to some marketing or managing or tourism or psychology poor faculty (remember - better are reserved for those kids who were reading books, not descriptions full of mistakes), end with no useful knowledge at all. They have wasted 8 years in total on something which is unnecessary for Poland and doesn't bring them joy or well-paid post (remember, smart kids were... and know they gather profits from this). It's a problem so huge that even European Union had noticed that and gave Poland funds to change that state. Unfortunately, there are no effects at all as I observe it. Our teacher only enlarges this phenomenon, because we all want to adjust the system, to invent new methods which will bring Poland fame, to cure lethal illnesses, to treat patients, to make academic career and to simply improve everyone's everyday live. Now, I want to explain last issue: we don't find this project boring or too difficult. No, it just should not be addressed to us - we can write papers, work on data or read the texts, but not waste so many hours on such stupid affair! Why I have spent my precious time on writing this? Well, I was frustrated so much that I could either publish my opinion somewhere or destroy some common property. I have a great esteem towards collective property, so I had no choice but to write this. Now I feel better. I can return to rewriting and rearranging from 400 pages thick book why Napoleon had the caesarean traits, why he was considered as the Saviour of nations and why Poles loved him so much. And how he was criticised. I have a feeling that after that I will definitely know more about connective tissue, muscular tissue, skeleton and circulatory system and write better the Wednesday test from them. Just wait until I will graduate with an academic degree and make you a prescription of two heroic virtues, one antithesis and four uprisings."
Polish,"How to type Japanese characters Day by day, I'm wasting my time playing boring games on facebook, watching tv and fighting with neighbour... today i say enough!

Polish,"The 21st Olympic Winter Games are finally open :D Yesterday after school my friend Dorota and me went to the shopping centre. We were talking and eating our favourite ice-cream which are selling only there, despite the fact that Dorota cought a cold. When I returned home I immediately turned on my TV. When I saw a pretty Canadian's landcape and the olympic flag I forgot about everything else. I was watching qualifications to the first ski jumping competition (which will take place today) with a big attention. I've been a big ski jumping fan since 2000 and I know names all of jumpers. :) Results of qualifications satisfy me. All of four Poles jumped long (especially Adam MaÅ‚ysz) and we'll can see them in the fight about medals. Of course I'll be supporting Poles, but the other ones too :D I exactly remember the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, eight years ago, when I was 10 years old. The Swiss person - Simon Amman won both of competitions - it was a very big surprise (Adam MaÅ‚ysz received the silver and the brown medal). They are likely to fight with each other again, probably the last time on the Olympics (but who knows? Everything is possible. Japanese jumpers are much older than them). During eliminations I started to think about what I should do with the opening ceremony. It was planning on the deep night according to Polish time. I love sleeping and at the first moment I thought: Oh no, I lose this wonderful event... But maybe one minute later I decided to watch it. When qualifications finished I washed and lied down. I was trying to sleep for more than one hour but it was impossible. So I switched on my computer and the radio. Finally I went to sleep at 11.30 pm. I woke up at 3 am and the first thing which appeared on my mind was: There is not as bad as I expect. So I turned on the TV. The opening ceremony was absolutely amazing! It was a meeting with the wonderful culture. Special effects made an enormous impression on me. The mix of views, colours, flames, ice etc. was just beatiful. The main performance with violins, a shade of a person on the yellow Moon, people who were flying, Indians, connected millions of people in front of the TV screens and took them to the mysterious, mystical and colourful world. A crowd of sportsmans from all around the world, who were showing their flags and who were proud of their nations - what an incredible view! Even if we couldn't see some of the biggest stars (for example Adam MaÅ‚ysz and Justyna Kowalczyk weren't there, because of their close starts). I'm always happy to see exotic countries on the Olympic Games. Skiers from Africa - isn't it just great? I recommend you to read about Robel Teklemariam. He comes from Ethiopia and is a skier. http://5dreams.panasonic.net/robel_teklemariam/ << this is his blog. Let's read about his dreams. I'm adding to this post his video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDKbKvJLUEk But we can't forget about the terrible accidant which happen a couple of hours before the opening ceremony. The sportsman from Georgia Nodar Kumaritashvili died. It's so sad and it's hard to stop tears. But I think his dream came true... He was on the Olympics. In 1968 in Grenoble a Pole StanisÅ‚aw Paczka died in the very similar accident. I must say that the olympic flag is a something very important for me. This is the symbol of coexistence of continents, despite the borders and differences. I prefer version with white circles in the blue background. And wonderful Bryan Adams was singing during the ceremony:D Who will you be supporting during the Olympics? And which competitions are the most interesting for you?"

Probably I'll made a lot of mistakes, because my English isn't very good. In my opinion I should learn something more after nine years. Anyway! I'm really cheerful and funny person. I have a lot of sense of humor, but I tend to be rude and mean, if I don't like someone. I'm also ironic, sarcastic, audacious and really arogant (You have no idea...). Some people just afraid of me. Maybe that's because I'm honest person and I'm saying what I think, and truth isn't always the best thing in our lives. I'm also going to high school, in Polish, of course. It's biology and chemistry class, so it's quite hard faculty. Apart from this I'm going to write a book (with my friend) , which will become the biggest world bestseller! Yea! Ok... How you can see - I'm also crazy. Finally I think learning language with lang-8 will be funny and pleasant experience. And right now, one thing I'm doing, is counting down the days to my eighteenth birthday. 20th January I won't be a child anymore... Oh, just ignore the last one... Have a nice evening! :) (Oh, God, there are a lot of mistakes, aren't there?)"
Polish,"Nice to meet you.^^ Hello everybody! It is my first day on this website. I wanted to introduce myself and check is there any mistakes?I hope you will help me find them all! My friends call me Zuzia in short. I come from Poland and I am 14. I am learning three languages: English,Japanese and French. I've been learning english since I turned 7:). French is in my life since I started attending Grammar School... I am in the second class already. And this year I explored Japanese... I really love this language and a culture of Japan. I hopefully believe that someday I will go to Japan. :) I am interested in photography, I am inspired by my dad, his photos are beautiful. So that will be all. ^^"
Polish,"After-Easter stomach It's been very long time since I was there. I'm ashamed of myself. Easter, as every long weekend, was too short but long enough to make me feel bloated. So now I'm open to your suggestions on how to get rid of this full-stomach feeling. Personally, I prefer and recommend cycling. Cheers!"
Polish,"Sleeping and waking up at early morning I found a mystery of waking up at early morning. You certain heard in old films, that people were waking up at early morning (when sun arises) and then they were eating breakfast. Why they immediately were eating, why there weren't laying. Answer is simply, beacause they was very hungry and they wasn't able to focus on dreaming or other stuff. When were you hungry at morning? If you aren't hungry at morning, it is unhealthy, because you couldn't eat big breakfast (big breakfast is healthy). Why aren't you hungry at morning? Because you ate before sleeping. I've realised that I get to sleep, when I'm hungry, I will have better sleep and I'll wake up and I won't be laying, I'll have to stand up and go to have a breakfast."

The funniest part of our conversation was pronunciation of polish words :D (It is really hard to say correctly it if you're not the Pole) I didn't think that there will be to many people from around the world. I was a volunteer (attache of delegation<--explanation to xtian from... FRANCE :D ) They was G R E A T ! Six persons came to Poznan for this championship. We spent together something about 20 hours during this 3 days, but I really become attached to them especially to one of them ( I spend most of time talking with him).

Polish,"Wrrr I really hate work in pairs! I hate them very very hard. ;x Why? During all lessons at school I sit with a girl Dorota. Of course, on english lessons too. And she is very bad from this language. Our teacher likes when students work together, I mean write dialogues etc. When I do something with Dorota, I must work for two people, because she can't. This is horrible! And I have never heard ""dziÄ™kujÄ™"" (""thank you"")... I'm not great from english and write sth big isn't easy for me, but she has never tried to help me! Probably, she'll get a mark for nothing from english tomorrow. Nothing? For my text... I would like to tell her what I think about them. But I won't do this. I'll keep it to myself."
Polish,"Running I'll be very thankful if you correct it :) I had always been terrible in sports. In short, I hated sport, psychical education and everything what connects with it. When I was 7 I started school and I couldn't manage with sport lessons - I was weak and I couldn't, for example running fast, catching a ball. I've never been in good form. In May I bought professional sports trainers destined to running. And I started running. Now I'm in the best condition I've ever been and I fell great! I don't feel weak, I have a lot of energy and I think I can do everything :) Today I've run only 30 minutes, but I'm going to run the marathon in the future, maybe next year, who knows? I want to tell one: running is a great fun and makes me happy! When I'm running, I feel free and I think only about surrounding stretch, and it's very funny when people look at you funnily."

Arabic,"From people have nothing at all to people have-it-all Once upon a time, a man wanted to put his house on sale and buy a new one. He went to one of his friend who was a business man and an expert in marketing. He asked him to help him with writing the announcement for the house sale. This expert new the house very well. So he wrote a detailed description, describing it's beautiful location, large area and it'sÂ spectacular artistic design. Then he talked about the huge pool and the garden and how charming they were. After he was done writing the announcement, he read what he wrote to the owner who was listening very carefully. When he was finished, the owner asked him to read it again, and so he did. Then the owner shouted, ""Oh my God! What a marvelous house! "" I've been dreaming for my whole life to have such a great house. I've never realized that I'm living in it until you described it to me. He smiled to his friend and said, ""Please don't publish this announcement. My house isn't on sale any more."". There is an old saying that says, ""Count the blessings that you have in your life. Write them down one by one and you'll feel much happier than before.Â "" We complain because there are thorns beneath flowers while what should be doing is to be grateful that there are flowers above the thorns. A man said I was hurt because I had a bare feet. But then I became grateful and thanked God for that for making me that way when I found that another man didn't have legs. How many people wished to have what you have. Such as; your car, your house, your cellphone, your certificate, your job, your family, your partner... How many people walk with bare feet while you're driving a car? How many people sleep in the streets while you have a home? How many people wish to get a chance to learn while you have one of the best certificates? How many...? How many...? You might not believe that there is such people. The people who walk with bare feet or sleep in the street or can't afford learning. But there are people like that. Besides there are people who are grateful even when they have nothing but crumbs. Isn't it the time for us start being grateful for what we have. So my advice for today is ""Be Grateful"". There is a beautiful touching song that I'd like to share with you. Here it is, I hope you'd like it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6IBdHW_rY"
Arabic,"Friendly places Everyone has his warm place to go when he feels bad. We might find some friendly places such as beaches, own rooms, parks etc. For example when I feel despair on something I'd go to my own room and prostrate in front of Allah and ask whatever I want and then Feel comfortable. Friendly places can decrease the pressure in the person. like when someone thinks about something he goes to the park sitting on the branch and talking to the sea waves. Well known that the sea hides our secrets. friendly places can give you comfortable atmosphere in life, can make you forget all the pains, sadness and bad stuff that happened to you in your life."

Arabic,"The Egyptian People And The New Dawn: stories from the revolution Before reading this entry, please make sure that you read the previous one for comprehension and consistency: http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/799106/The-Egyptian-Revolution I know that I promised to tell you how the Egyptians saved their own country. So, I'm writing this entry. The Egyptians keep surprising me and I have a feeling that they're going to surprise me even more in the near future. Let me tell you why I'm grateful to these people: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1) When about 30,000 prisoners ran away from their prison and all the disasters that I talked about in the previous entry happened, people had to protect themselves. Prisoners took many weapons and they used them of course. They would simply knock on the door, the next thing you know is that people are hurt and your apartment was robbed. So here is what Egyptians did to handle this dilemma. All men in every street went down to their street and each one of them got something to use as weapon: thick stick, pipe, gun,... etc. my mom and I found us two sticks and made them ready by the door, just in case. The people who belong to each street would gather from the starting time of the curfew and start their night shift. Some of the people stand at the beginning of the street, some of them at the end and the rest of them wandering in the street. They also put boulders across the street (at the beginning and end of the street) except for about two meters in the middle to allow cars to pass. They would use more borders in the middle if the street was too long. Each car that wants to pass must be inspected carefully by the people standing at this inspection point. They also used signs between them like a whistling if they were suspicious about something, so back up would come immediately from the people who's wandering in the street. Sometimes, they found prisoners, boxes of weapons, stolen things and lots of cash. Once they find anything suspicious, they'd call the military hotline to come and take these people. The best thing about this is that people used not to know their neighbors but after that time that they spent together from about 6:00 pm to 8:00 am, they came to know each other very well. Besides, you never see someone standing to protect his own building or his own family... but he stands to protect the people who are living in the whole street. Egyptians came to know what "" We're all one "" really means. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMdYKY2KHSg ********************************** 2) Some of the prisoners went straight to the museums to steal the precious pieces there. Consequently, some people gathered and went to build human walls around these museums. They were to stay from night to dawn around every museum. If I were to wish for one last thing before I die, I would have wished to see this scene with my own eyes. Another problem faced the people is that there was no traffic man, so some of the people volunteered to do that and you can see that in the previous video. ********************************** 3) You're never going to believe this one. Some people had some serious injuries (most of the injuries were losing one eye or both of them by gunshots. very brutal, I know) because of the police's violence. They'd go to the emergency (it was not exactly a hospital but I'll tell you what it was later) and then get back to the square to continue their mission and to stand with their brothers and sisters who are fighting for freedom. Can you see how precious freedom is for the Egyptian people? I've seen people who have only one leg joined this revolution as well. *********************************** 4) The Egyptian world that was represented in Tahrir Square. Honestly, this needs an entry just to talk about this tiny world but I'll try to be as brief as possible. Tahrir world consisted of one big family that consisted of hundreds of thousand of members. All these people shared food, water and most importantly goal. You would see many people coming in the morning holding huge bags full of bread and other food. When you ask them what this is for, they'd immediately answer that it is for the people in Tahrir Square. They would instantly go in and distribute what they have on these people although they most likely don't know any of these people. They also clean it and sweep the floor of Tahrir Square. *********************************** 5) At hard times, when Muslims were to pray, Christians made a human wall around them so no one would hurt them. That shows that in Egypt Muslims and Christians are one. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEX8dNhZJ60 *********************************** 6) A mosque near Tahrir Square was used as a hospital and hundreds of doctors volunteered to save the injured people. It wasn't a five-star hospital but they used what they had so as to save lives. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoT7ILQHoLI This one is in English: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZN3Y6_s9hs *********************************** 7) Today and after everything was over and Mubarak has finally stepped down. They made a campaign to clean the square and renovate what was broken there. They also agreed to build a memorial for the people who died there and who died all over the country in the same cause. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSo4tOSF9M *********************************** Oh, sorry, I didn't know that I wrote that much. So many miracles happened in the las few days. I could go on for days writing about this. I'm just going to conclude with something that is now said (and most importantly felt) repeatedly among Egyptians: a great Egyptian leader once said "" If I wasn't Egyptian, I would have wished to be one. "" ---------------------------------------------------------- Photo #1: Muslims praying in Tahrir Square. Photo #2: The Cross and The Quran together united to constitute not a Muslim nor a Christian... but an Egyptian. Photo #3: A wedding party that took place in Tahrir Square a week ago. The bride and groom said to the people in Tahrir Square, ""We'd never find a better audience to celebrate our wedding with than you (all protesters)."""
Arabic,"like stars on earth I have just finished watching this movie taare zameen par. Such amazing movie full of bright feelings and emotions It's my first time to watch it even though all my family have watched before and I have gotten the chance to watch it but I just missed it and now I have ^__^ ok, now there is just one exam remained, today my exam was Managerial Economi It was awesome, just one mistake xD and I have gotten two grades so far, The Isalmic Culture and I've gotten A+ Awwww and Accounting and I've gotten B+ >> still good though :D I still worried about one of subject that I had last week wich is Management Principles I hope I can get more than A not B or B+ T_T Well, since I dont have exam tomorrow I managed tonight to get rest and make some icons <3 This what I love to do when I feel free or when I want to feel better and maybe I will make icons for Hakuouki anime for thousands time hehehe so now it's time to say goodbye for this night.. ^_^ Bye"
Arabic,"My emotion Sometimes we discover our self through troubles and stances. I think I am a calm person but when I engaged in hard talk with my friend, I lost my ability to control my feelings and couldn't say anything and felt my mind and thinking were stopped from working. I know I can express about my feeling with a good manner if I was calm but what I can do with my emotions."
Arabic,"Freedom is precious. Today is very crucial in the Egyptians` life. Today, all the Egyptians can sleep in peace because Mubarak steped down at last. He declared his decision at six pm. I heard that he left Eygpt, and travelled to Germany. When I heard the decision I felt that I want to cry out fo joy at first, and out of sympathy. At first, I wanted to cry out of joy because the tyrannical authority of Mubarak has fallen, but I wanted to cry out of sympathy because I didn`t want Mubarak to leave Egypt, you know that Mubarak is eighty three, I wanted him to die in his country, at last he is a human being whatever he did. But when I remembered that his wealth is seventy milliar dollar whereas thre are a lot of hungry people in his country I said that he deserves what happened to him because he didn`t merce his people, therefore, he shouldn`t be merced as welll. This is a lesson for every president to know that injustice leads to painful end like Mubarak`s. Eventuially, I want to say that congratulations for all the Egyptians, you have been patiant for thirty years, congratulations for all the youth, men, women, and children who spent more than two weeks in the streets calling for their demands. I want to tell them all I am so proud of you. You are really Egyptians."
Arabic,"Grammar is my nightmare. Hello everyone. :) My name is Dina. I love English language so much. I learn it at school. Then I try to improve my english skill by watching TV shows, series, and songs. And by making a lot of friendship with people who understand English and not speaking my native language. When I watch talk shows, series, movies I can understand 97% of it. And I can speak english fluently. But my problem is grammar. When I wrote any sentence I become so confused because I'm not sure if what I wrote is have grammatical errors. One of my friends said:""don't worry, no one care if you have grammatical mistakes or not. even the native speakers make grammatical mistakes"". But I really do care. Actually I'm totally nervous about my mistakes in this entry. >.<"""
Arabic,"HUMAN CULTURE My object today is gonna be about human culture or we can say its about things in common between all people around the world . I think one of those things is religion ,and when i talk about religion i do not mean exact one like being christian , muslim ,buddhist or any thing else. And i think may be more than 90% of the whole people have their own religion and this means its very important thing. So the question is why we need religion, i think its because we need some thing like food for our spirit... actually you can see yourself looking at the sky when you are sad or needing power from god to help you. At last i think every one of us should have his religion to be comfortable and to support him in his long life..:) Thank you for reading and i hope i can see your gladly acceptable comments....;)"
Arabic,"A Day In Transportation In Egypt Transportation in Egypt could be considered as an adventure or a tragedy, especially in Cairo. Anyone who had been to Egypt before can tell why. I think it's more like a sport really, as it consists of two actions: running and hopping. We haven't got to the hardest part yet. When I go out at 7 am, It's almost impossible to find not an empty seat, but an empty aisle in any bus. So, now I have to do the running, the hopping and the standing in the aisle. Now, this is the hardest part. Standing in the -- 30 cm wide --Â aisleÂ isn't going to be just standing; it's getting squashed by the people who are trying to get from the back of the bus to the front; it's reeling like drunk people every time the driver hits the break; it's hanging from this rusty iron cylinder like monkeys. To be fair, it isn't always that bad, sometimes a gentleman offers me his seat, and I kindly accept his offer (I can never deny an offer like that?!) I'm not always that lucky, and I don't blame the setting men for that, it's such a hard decision to make. Leaving his seat is like choosing hell over heaven, well, setting on a seat isn't exactly like heaven, but we'll get to that in a second. Where were we? Ah, the lack of gentlemen which was led by the hard and awful circumstances. Enough talking about the aisle people. Let's assume that I got lucky and found an empty seat (in my dreams!). Mostly this seat is going to be an aisle seat, so I'm sandwiched between the aisle person and the person setting next to me (Lets hope that both of them are on a diet). I cannot tell the aisle person to step back just a little bit, because there is no back. Technically, the back is the front, so I wouldn't even dare to ask. And I can't ask the person setting next to me to budge a little bit, because if there was any free space they wouldn't hesitate to do so, instead of sticking to the next person in this hot summer. So, there isn't any way out, is it? I just try to find something to distract me until I get to my destination. I usually read a book or look out of the window trying to notice new things I haven't noticed before. Many might ask why don't I get a car and save myself all the trouble. My answer is three words: car accidents, stupid, impolite drivers and same congestion problem. This was about four hours of my daily routine. Amazing, right? I get to do some exercises and have a ride in a roller coaster, what could be better than that?!"

I was supporting Qatar, it is a small country but it has a big ambition to host this event, it has hosted Asian games before and it will host Asian cup next January 2011. I didn't expect Qatar will win and I was surprised too, because Qatar didn't play in world cup before, and people in the world still don't have enough information about it, but this is a chance to present a true picture and the great culture of this area. 12 years seems so long, and I don't know how I'll be at that time, but I wish to go there and support my team and be with people from all over the world."

Arabic,"How leave happy life.. Some people think that by money you can buy happiness. If that's true why we still see that rich people are suffering from money, why most of them have crimes and gangs. Some poor people find poverty is a grace, they see how some rich people are suffering- paying taxes, insurance life,buying their souls just to serve Gangsters.. etc-. To talk about beautiful life, what should we follow?and who?. beautiful life can be considered as the ideal example to the simple person. simple person is someone who just cares on his family, his work, the God and the guidance from him. Without these we can not live happily. for instance, when you are getting ready to an exam what should you do to get a high grade?. I think not only cramming, but understanding the meaning of what are you studying is more beneficial than that. so first you should reach the point then to start prepare you self through them. Live, play, worship, know your duties and then you will reach the changes."

Arabic,"Songs Stuck In My Head Do you know when you listen to a song and you feel like this song is goingÂ to stick in your head forever? That's what happened to me when I listened to the songs in the videos below. The first song is called ""Hold My Hand"". It's talking about the bad things happening in the world right now and how sad it is. It says that we'll always be neighbours in this world, so we'll always be stuck with each other, therefore we have to surrender to the fact that we have to be good to each other (I made it sound bad, didn't I? Well, you'll get what I mean when you listen to it). It's using western music with a phrases and topics that we're familiar with, that's why it captured many people's attention. The second song is called ""For the Rest Of My Life"". This song is like the best present a man could give to his wife. I've never felt that the millions of romantic songs around the world have any honesty in them, but this one makes an exception. I really don't know why, maybe because it touches our world more than other songs or maybe because it expresses love in a more sophisticated, delicate and honest way, I don't know. Finally, (which was supposed to be ""first of all"", but I didn't want to start with it so as not to steal the light from the songs) the amazing singer who made these wonderful two songs is Maher Zain. I'm sure the people who have been reading my entries are bored of reading this name. If you don't remember him, let's refresh your memory. He is the Islamic singer living in Sweden. He worked as a music producer with RedOne (a gifted music producer who was fast rising in the music scene in Sweden). RedOne was on the verge of breaking into the big time, going on to work with artists like Akon, Lady Gaga, Enrique Iglesias, Brandy, New Kids on the Block, and Michael Jackson. But Maher's career has taken another turn. He started making his own songs and singing them. He started choosing some topics which might fix some ideas concerning our community. Enough talking!

Arabic,"Fencing,lethal,glance off,swift,tedious,renowned,hyenas,hinder,peek There couldn't be such beautifull landscape to meditate on. The sunlight glancing off the broad see... But unimaginably something wrong was happening. I took a peek just around me and guess what 3 Hyenas was just meditating near me . I was frightened. I slapped my cheek to verify whether it was a dream or the truth... But it wasn't a dream . I was afraid from their lethal jaw i knew that it was the end ,this is gonna hinder all my dreams. Suddenly they started speaking : ""What a beautifull landscapes isn't it?"" I was O__o (hyenas speaking ????? what's going on???) Hyenas:""Follow us and you will be alright"" I swiftly answered:"" Yes sir "". Then I followed them. they took some secret passage that couldn't be found easily. After walking for one hour. We finally arrived at destination it was the hyenas village,it was very shocking some Hyenas was fencing with their lethal katana you could hear the clashing sound very well it was frightning others were playing karate ,some of them were just doing nothing. Hyenas:""Move on "" They took me into a temple a magnificient temple with a huge hyenas status over the rooftop. Suddenly when i entered the temple there was some hyenas praying my mind couldn't believe what was happening i had a terrible headache . Again they drove me to another room. The walking was tedious . I was asking where they are taking me? Entered that room again there was a dark staircase. We downed the stairs. At my astonishement i've never saw such a beautiful place there was a big Hyenas sitting on a huge Royal chair it seemed to be their king. He was admiring the landscape that i described while ago i don't know how it could be possible. I was still under the surprise ,suddenly o loud voice was coming from the whole building : wake up ,wake up you are late for your university what are they gonna say you have entered the most renowned university on the city so don't be lazy ... Grrrr it was my mother voice, but i was still in the dream i told to the hyenas bye bye let's continue this script next time it was on the middle of the film and I was the hero ... Suddenly a terrible slap made me wake up like a zombie i smiled and took my way into the daily routine."
Arabic,"King Abdullah returned to Saudi Arabia. Yesterday, King Abdullah came back from Morocco. He went there for convalescence, after got treatment in the USA. Before about 3 months, he got a healthy problem, they said itâ€™s Herniated disc. So, he went to the USA for treatment. It was the Hajj season when that happened, and we were on vacation for 3 weeks. He gave us one more week, and requested us to ask Allah curing him. When the Hajj finished he delivered a short speech, here is some of what he said: â€œ I thank all who asked about me, and I thank all Saudis. I say, as you all are fine, Iâ€™m fine. I donâ€™t know what is the cause of this problem. But if Allah will, Iâ€™ll get well soon. Iâ€™m asking Allah to save you all and make you successful. And please, forgive me for not standing up while Iâ€™m talking to you. â€œ His words were so kind, he was like a father talking to his sons and daughters. No wonder why he is called The King of Humanity. Heâ€™s also called The Falcon of Arabism. Yesterday, all my way to the university there were welcomed panels for the king, also many buses were posted welcomed stickers. One citizen who works as a taxi driver, heard that the kingâ€™s health became better(that was a few months ago), then he offered that heâ€™ll deliver people without any payment until the king come back to Saudi Arabia. He said that he has another work. Thus, no worry about money. ++ The second picture shows the back window of his taxi. ++ When I was searching about a photo of King Abdullah, I found many Photoshop designs for him. A lot of people were congratulated him for being fine. I just realized how much Saudis love King Abdullah. ++ Here is one of those designs. ++"

Arabic,"Quotes: Don't Cry Because It's Over, Smile Because It Happened ""Don't cry because it's over; smile because it happened."" ~ Theodor Seuss Geisel. I was stunned by the positivity of this quote. It's a very beautiful saying, especially, when one say it to the right person, at the right time. Some people just need to hear things like that, not want, but need. Words like this could make a dramatic changes on someone's life. Another quote that one of my friends posted on facebook yesterday was, ""Life is too short to waste time on someone who is unworthy of your love.Â It's so sad when the right person won't be able to search for you, because you are too busy all your life making the wrong person right for you."" I think quotes doesn't need to relate to you personally so as you can feel it. Sometimes, it works as an experience that you gain for not making the mistake. ""Those who criticize our generation forget who raised it."" I've got to agree with this one. When I read this, I thought these are just the words that gown ups need to hear these days.Â Criticizing our generation became like a daily routine to them. I'll memorize that saying, and next time I see someone criticizing us, I'll shoot them with these words.:) â€œIn order to have great happiness you have to have great pain and unhappiness, otherwise how would you know when youâ€™re happy?â€ ~ Leslie Caron. I totally believe in this saying. I tell myself this every time I feel depressed or unhappy. I convince myself that sadness is what makes happiness more sweet. Most of these sayings seem very obvious that I can't believe that I didn't figure them out myself. Well, we call this in Arabic Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù‡Ù„ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù…ØªÙ†Ø¹. I'm not sure if this expression exists in English or not, but it's literally translated to ""The easy abstainer"". This doesn't seem right (little help in here, John). Anyway, what it means that some things seem so easy when you read them but when you try to imitate them, you can't. This expression is usually used with when we're talking about poetry -- for the same reason --. I'd love to hear more good quotes, so if you have some good ones please post it in here. Thanks."
Arabic,"The Gum Was the Solution I didn't know that this little rubbery thing was the solution of my problem which I suffered from, since I can remember. The problem was that when I used any media of transportation I got sick, not always. But it became even worse if I tried toÂ read. This really annoyed me, because I had to use the bus every day to go to college. I also had to fulfill the promise that I made to myself which states that I should read a book every week. The only time a day that I get the chance to read was in my way to and back from college. I had two choices, whether to force myself to stay up late to read enough pages so as to finish the book at the end of the week, or I could try to pull it together and keep reading in the two hours and a half that I spend in the bus and fight these fever like symptoms to read as much as possible. The first one was hard to achieve because I always has to get up at 5 or 6 o'clock, and the latter could not also be achieved because I would not be able to concentrate on what I'm reading if I'm feeling sick. Hmm, what a tough decision! I spent few days following the first methods and other days following the second. Until one day, I had a gum in my purse which I found by chance when I had just got into the bus and was trying to find my book. I took the book and the gum out of my purse. I started chewing the gum and reading the book. And for the first time, I didn't get sick at all. I finally found the solution to pull me out of my my misery, I mean my sickness. That was it, from then on, I read every day 20 pages from my book in the bus without feeling anything at all. I just drift away with the story, live in a whole new world, until my stop comes. Then I have to put my dear book back in my purse and chase the dreams out of my head, then come back to reality. I just wish if the bus can take more time so I can read more of my book. But the trip must come to and end and so my dreams, what a pity!"

Arabic,"Life Life is a great mystery. When life gives you something,it must take another things. life doesn't give us all things that we desire. In life some people have things that others haven't,So these people should help others as social solidarity. God created the universe each of us needs others. Another thing that we always are sad when we couldn't get something,or we couldn't achieve a dream. why are we sad?!the universe will die , we will die also. However, we should should work hard to achieve our dreams. ""live as you will die tomorrow and learn as you will live forever"". We appreciate Life,as it gift from Allah."
Arabic,"Confused! We always say that the heart is the source of love, hatred, happiness, sorrow and all the cannot-be-expressed feelings. We say, ""I know it deep inside my heart"". When we have a conflict between emotions, we know that the arena is taking place inside the pumping heart. The arteries seem like a bridle holding a ravaging horse trying to break free of these ties. A broken heart is when people get hurt, which is a something that accompanies the feeling of betrayal or guilt. One could really feel like a dagger has been punched through their heart. I'm sure that you're now thinking, ""what the hell is she talking about? and what does that have to do with being confused?"" I'm going to give you a peace of mind and tell you what is confusing me in a form of a question. If the heart is the bowl that holds all these emotions, why doesn't heart transplants heal the broken hearts?"
Arabic,"fanaticism When we come to this life, we come without anything, no knowledge, no ability to think, and in the process of time, our parents form our ideas, our visions, our impressions of life, of existence and of human being.

In this moment of thinking, born fanaticism in our heart and refuse any concepts that differ with our concepts The question is: How can we get rid of intolerance and be able to judge things objectively?"

Arabic,my favourite type of music i remember that my first type of music i listened to was french rap .... i was young (1995) and i didn't understand a single word ... because i used to listen to it with my cousin who lives in france .. after that i discovered techno music ... but i didn't listen to it for long and soon i switched to english rap (2pac) which i really liked .. and in 1997 i discovered the king of pop MICHAEL JACKSON .. at first i didn't like his songs a bit ... and i was dissapointed .. but after listening to those tapes a few times i became addicted to them and i bought all his albums ( still i don't understand a word) .. after that in the year 2000 .. i heard EMINEM for the first time and that's when i started to understand some english and i forgot about mj ... and that's when i loved the hiphop style ... i listened to 2pac eminem snoop dogg d12 and others ( i even became a break dancer ) and during that period i used a lot of drugs ( be careful music can change your life ) .... anyway . after that i fed up with hiphop and started to listen to classical music and opera and guess what i returned to MICHAEL JACKSON again .... because after i tested a lot of music types that michael's music was the best ( and now i can also understand the lyrics )
Arabic,"Back To Life It's been a long time since I last wrote anything on Lang-8. I will try not to do that again because I really missed everyone here. I finished my exams and summer vacation has started. I realized that the best thing about vacation is anticipating it because once I'm there, it doesn't feel that great and fun. Most of the time I stay indoors because I hate the hot weather. I've always loved staying home and just stay 24/7 on the internet, watching TV or reading, but it's more dull now. It's true that I meat a lot of people online and get the chance to chat about a variety of topics. It doesn't feel like fun any more. I want to go out, I want to see real people -- not that the ones I'm talking to online are not real but I want to socialize. Sometimes, I would stay home for a whole month -- just me and my laptop, which was something I used to enjoy -- but I ended up being like a moving corpse. So, lately I've realized that I can stand the heat but I can't stand this solitary. What I did was that I enrolled in an English Conversation course. It's a very good way to redirect the pent-up energy -- the energy was directed to killing me and now it's directed to socializing, better, don't you think? In this course, we talk the whole time in English, discuss things, do individual and group presentations, watch a movie, listen to a song and read short stories. There are some other things that they told us that they are going to accomplish by the end of this course but I can't recall them. Have you experienced the feeling that I was talking about before (being trapped in your own house and ending up being miserable)?"
Arabic,"Will Smith & Chris Gardner Will Smith & Chris Gardner When you hear those two names, the first thing that should come to your mind is ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is a movie starred by the great actor Will smith. In this movie Will Smith is impersonating Chris Gardner who was a homeless-divorced father who became a millionaire. This didn't happen over day and night but it happened after a hard struggle with determination. At the beginning of this movie, you can see that he was only hoping for survival as he didn't have any money and he was raising his son all by himself. Even in the darkest times when he was kicked out of his apartment as he didn't have any money to pay the rent. So this ment that he and his son were have to spend the night in the streets... What can a man do when he encounter such a devastating situation? What choices does he have?! I guess not much! Let's see what he did... He and his son were setting on a bench on a metro station. He had this machine with him which was all he had (It's some medical machine he used to sell for living). He told his son that this was a time machine, of course his son didn't believe him at first but then he pushed a button in the machine and started telling him that he's seeing dinosaurs. His son started to cope with him pretenind to be imagining these things too. ""We gotta find some place safe, we need a cave... we gotta find a cave"" Chris told his son, then he took him to the bath room in pretending that this was the cave. After that, he let his son put his head on one of his legs to sleep, blocking the door of the bath room with the other leg. Then, he started crying and of course I couldn't hold the tears in my eyes any longer so I cried with him :(( :(( :(( It was a very touchy moment, actually, the best scene in the whole movie. Anyway,If i'm going to write about this movie according to how much I love it, then it's going to need lots of pages from me to write it and lots of hours from you to read it. Finally, I recommend this movie to those who haven't seen it yet. You're missing a lot if you don't see it. Best of luck everyone!"

Arabic,"The end of the first step! I did mention before that football is my favorite sports, and the world cup is the most important event for this sport. Today, it was the last match for our national team. After Slovenia and England, we had a game against the USA. Before the world cup begins, I expect a lost against Slovenia; not because they are very strong, but because our team would not feel the competition at the beginning. A win against England and a draw with the US, but after a draw with the British it was obvious that our task is harder than I thought. I saw American's play since 94, and their match against Slovenia, they had more determination to win than the English. Well, being coaching by a marines explain there determination! Especially on the attack, even that there defense was less effective, but lucky them we didn't had a strong attack, but a strong defense that stand up against Americans attack for more than 90 minutes. In the lasts seconds, after a rebounded ball, the Americans scored. Thought with a draw we would not pass anyway neither with one goal; the Americans had more motivation and they made it. Now I'll continue to watch the world cup with less pressure and enjoy the event :) I thing that Argentina will be the champion this time, how about, what you think? * As always, I have to post some music :) This time it's a music style called Guenawi it's known in south Algeria, Morocco, and Mali they have sort of bohemian style if I may say the singer here is : Amazigh Kateb singing : Les AlgÃ©riens (Algerians) Enjoy ;) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWp3VVU0TCE&playnext_from=TL&videos=MS5Cu2BQZB0"

I also would become nervous when I saw a lot of people looking at me. My eyes would start to tear and my whole body would begin to shake. â€¢ One day, my school had a big celebration. They were very excited and they started preparing for the celebration about one month before. My teacher asked me to sing a song in the celebration. . I told her, ""No ,I can't."" because I was very shy. But she wanted to teach me how to overcome my fear. She worked hard training me to be very confident. When the celebration began, I could not sleep the night before the celebration. Because I was very scared. When my turn began, I was trying to be strong, but in the end my heart was beating faster, my hands were shaking and my face was very red . Because all eyes were on me. â€¢ In the end, I felt very shy when I saw my teacher. Because I didn't do what she expected from me. I will never forget that embarrassing moment . I really was very nervous and scared."

Arabic,"How Can You Choose the Language That You Want To Learn? I though I would ask the people here that question, then I thought, ""why don't I find it out myself, and then write an entry about it?"" and so I did. Here is a wonderful website I found during my research: http://www.micheloud.com/FXM/la/la/index.htm This website has some observations of 19 languages that might help to assess if a specific language is what you want to learn. It is very organized and helpful. It also lists some good criterion about language assessment, like: overall difficulty, hours needed for learning each language, countries speaking them and more other things that certainly will help anyone make a decision. Another cool website which summarizes the most popular languages: http://www.omniglot.com/language/which.htm This website have some other good criterion for language assessment. Some of them are: availability, usefulness... and the most important criteria isÂ languages for demand by employers. The next link is another great languages' research: http://www.cla.purdue.edu/fll/GBL/BackIssue/VOL3/Uber.pdf This research is called Corporate Recruiter Demand For Foreign Language And Cultural Knowledge. Most of the statistics in this research indicates that this is only USA's perspective of second languages demand. I had a quick review of this research, but I'll have a careful reading of it later. I hope this helps you to sort out your priorities of language studying."

Arabic,"What is the Difference Between Love and Friendship? It means: Can a lover be a friend? And a friend be a lover? The answer is yes! But love and friendship are different. Here is the definition: Friendship cannot end! A friend for a day may still a friend for tomorrow. Unlike love! When love goes, it wont come back. The one who we fall in love with then we forget him, we do not love him again. But friendship is like a tough tree passes all seasons and stay proof if there is someone water it. Love is like a flower with thorns. A flower drinks from two glasses. Friendship can become a love. It usually starts as love. But love cannot turn into friend ship and lover cannot convert to be just a friend. The one who you love you always want him to be yours, but your friend is for everybody. Friendship has levels. It starts from the base and ends in the climax. It begins with number one and finish in infinity. You can find a close friend, a little closer, or a friend who barley can remembered. And the close friend may become a remote one and verse versa. These hypotheses are not existing in the thesis of love. Love cannot be parts and has no levels. It has one level. Love cannot fly except high. You can't love a person then this love will decrease because love doesn't accept the half of solutions. Either it is strong or ends forever."

Arabic,"Four things you can never retrieve A lady was waiting for her plane at the airport. She was going to wait for a whileÂ so she bought a book and a packet of biscuits. She sat down and started reading her book while eating the biscuits. There was a man sitting next to her, reading his own book. Surprisingly, when she took the first piece of biscuit from the packet which was put between her and the man next to her, this man started taking a piece of biscuit from the same packet. With every piece she took, the man took one too. She started to get angry but she tried to control her anger. When there was one piece only left in the packet. She looked at it and said to herself, ""What is this rude man going to do now?"". For her surprise, the man took this piece, split it into two halves, ate one of them and left the other for her. At this moment, she was really mad at him but she didn't say anything to him. She took her book and went to her plane. After she sat down in her seat, she opened her purse to look for her glasses. She did find them, but she also found her packet of biscuits! She was shocked and felt ashame of herself. She realized that her packet was in her purse all the time and the man was generous and kind enough to let her eat from his biscuits and he never complained about it. So she felt even more ashamed and stupid. She was speechless, she couldn't find any convenient words to apologize to him. So there are 4 things which can never be retrieved. 1- You can't retrieve the stone after throwing it. 2- You can't retrieve words after saying them. 3- You can't retrieve chances after missing them. 4- You can't retrieve time after it passes. So make sure that you act correctly. Don't let chances slip off your hands and don't rush to quick decisions and judgements on others."

Divorce is a company went bankrupt after having implemented its balance of emotions. Secrets are information you disclosed it to others to exploit it against you when you feel with safety. Rumor is a plan faster than the voice. Cold war is a woman smile to another woman. Anger is a wind blow suddenly then it blows out mind light. Spite is a feeling of inferiority towards others and it transformed into hatred. Luck is a crutch to unsuccessful person and weapons to victorious. Generosity is a diplomatic need for dealing between people. Patience is a polite way of sufferance prevent the injured from compliant. Reading is a magic key opens the coffers of treasures to us. Time is a speed train which is impossible to stop it. Surrender is a weakness which leads to humiliation. Eloquence is replying with out slow down and hit without making a mistakes. Conscience is red sign which stops the human in front of him self to say the truth with it even for a moment. Smile is the oldest and fastest way for connecting, the human know it. It is also the only language which all people understand it. Longing is a rare metal which expands with heat and shrink with cold. Shyness is a rare moment which allows for a girl to look with a rosy face without powders. Silent is the best conversation between lovers. A good word is a slave bridge that connects the hearts of people over the sea of selfishness. Life is a ship its fuel is the work and its sail is the hope. Friendship is a profitable business deal between two hearts and two souls. The teacher book doesnâ€™t teach till the student move it. Hope is a candle which lights up paths full of sadness and fear then the wish rises. Optimism is a scent garden from roses among the thistle trees. Honor is the only thing that canâ€™t be never lost even if one time. The mother is the only creature that we find her in life with a truthful smile and with a thin anger. Farewell is necessary from it but it is easy to say it but it is more difficult to hear it. You find between people who are like pebbles and who are like jewelry. The tree is evaluated by its fruits. Only the confidence people who are conceal the secret and the secret by the best people is concealed. Masters of people in the world are the generous and in the hereafter are the pious. The best people who modest about his highness and pardoned about his ability and more equitable about the power. The person who knows the people is smart but the smarter who know himself. Lukman el-hakem said, recommending his son: Son: I never regretted from silence. Son: Retried the evil and it will retried you . the evil is created for the evil. Son: Take the obedience to God is a trade brings you profit without trade. Son: Donâ€™t sleep and eat more, the person who exceed from them will come bankrupt from good works in the day of resurrection. Son: If you drink from a well donâ€™t throw a stone in it. Son: A bird in you hand is better than a bull in the hand of someone else. Son: There are two things if you care with them you will not heed after them with any thing you do . they are your religion for you promised and your dirham for your pension. Son: There is no better than the heart and the tongue if they become good, also there is no bad than them if they corrupt. Son: Donâ€™t side with world or filling up you heart with it . you didn't create for it. Son: donâ€™t laugh with out wonder and donâ€™t ask about things which aren't particular for you. Son: attend the scientist with you knee and listen to them with you own ears because the heart lives by the light of the scientist. Son: I passed on many prophets and I learned several things from them. If you are in a pray, you must save you heart. If you are in a meeting, you must save your tongue. If you are in people houses, you must save you sight, and if you on food you must save your stomach. finally, there are two things you mustnâ€™t remind them never . they are the harming of people to you and your kindness to the people."

These stunts almost gave me a heart attack by just watching them. They require a very strong heart, a phenomenal talent and lot of practice.

She smiled saying â€œnot bad, I will tint my hair today.â€ she did this and she spent a wonderful day. In the next day, she wake up and looked in mirror, she found only two hairs in her head. She smiled saying â€œAmazing, I will change my hair style today, I will split it to two parts and make a divider in the middle.â€ She did that and spent a nice day. On the third day, she wake up and found only one hair in her head. She smiled and saying â€œExcellent, I will comb my hair to back.â€ She did this and spent a fun and happy day. One day she wake up and looked in the mirror to find her head free of hair perfectly. She saying with high voice â€œThatâ€™s amazing, I will not have to comb my hair today.â€ There is no doubt that there are many problems and obstacles in our life. Do not let your happiness depend on removing problems and obstacles. But live with them because your outlook to life is turning pain to hopes and groans to melodies and ring tones. Happiness is a decision so you should make it your first choice."

Arabic,"New Information about Saudi Arabia == 3 == Some of my friends told me that they liked my entries. Especially, those about Arabic and Saudi cultures. I really thank them, and Iâ€™ve written this information about Saudi Arabia as one of the Arabic countries. I think that I havenâ€™t talked about this information before. I hope itâ€™ll be interesting. ** There are 13 governmental universities and 8 private ones. Also, there are many colleges and institutes. The largest university is King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Thwal - a city near to Jeddah in the coast of The Red Sea -. This university is only for higher studies. ** Studying in governmental universities and schools is free. Textbooks are also free in both governmental and private schools. ** People here use their cars in moving from a place to another. Riding bikes and waking is rare. Each family has at least one car, and if it has old sons this number will increases. Because each son wants to have his own car. Thatâ€™s why streets here are extremely congested â€“ especially, in Jeddah and Riyadh -. Imagine what would happen if women drive ,too!! It would be a disaster !! ** Arabic coffee and dates are very important in every visiting to any Saudi house. The main two things in making Saudi coffee are ground coffee and cardamom, of course plus water. The other ingredients are different from a region to another or from a tribe to another. The another adds are saffron, ginger, or cloves . Saudi coffee is bitter, you should eat some sweet thing with it. ** The common way in greeting is shaking hands with cheek kiss (if you havenâ€™t seen the other person for a while or in occasions) or just shaking hands for everyday greeting or with formal people. Itâ€™s natural to see people hug and kiss each others in occasions. Like in the two holidays â€“ Eid Al-Fitir and Eid Al-Adha â€“ . After finishing the special prayer, as long as you wake in the streets, you see men hug each others and congratulate for this delighting occasion. - The photo has been taken after finishing the Eid prayer. - I hope those three entries added some new information to your knowledge. I wish that they weren't boring. Thanks for reading. ^__^"
Arabic,"I am having writing exam can you please correct this? Televisions!How can we live without them. They are considered as one of the most important things we should have in our homes. They are in every home. They keep us updated with the world . They are suitable for any age because of their variety programmes. They help to bring all the family together . Televisions also have many advantages and disadvantages. In recent years, televisions have improved greatly. They have a lot of different kinds of models and sizes. They also show a lot of different programmes for children,young people and elders. They can help childern to improve their language skills. For example,they can learn how to talk and understand another language . But sometimes they show bad programmes and that are not good for them. Even with those bad programmes they still watch them. Most of the people spend a lot of time watching them and that is not good for their health. However, they make us feel very happy. they also help us to exchange information and gain knowledge which could not in the past. They make us very comfortable. I think Television is the best invention in the history of the world . It has changed a lot of our habits. We can't live one day without watching it. It helps us to overcome our depression. It makes us feel very glad and comfortable."

Arabic,"Japanese vs. Spanish I was watching many Japanese animes and dramas. so, I learned some words. Then I felt that I like all Japanese things,and that made me learn more words and sentences. But after some months, I feel bored, then I stopped learning Japanese. Before one year I started learning Spanish, and I found it an interesting language. I still learn more and more in Spanish and that make me happy. Now, when I think about what I did, I find that I just did the right for me. Let me explain, About Japanese: * It has its own alphabet. so, I can't read nor write any thing in Japanese if I don't learn its alphabet, and that is difficult. Even if I use the Romaje, it'll not be useful for me. * I don't have friends from Japan and I can't have. So that I can't practice what I have learned and I'll forget it soon. * It's not an international language, people speak it only in Japan. About Spanish: * its alphabet is the same as English's. so, I can read and write it easily,and easier than English in my opinion, because you write the words as you pronounce it. * I have friends from Colombia and Mexico. I practice my Spanish with them. * Spanish is the forth international language in the world. It is the native language in Spain, the second language in U. S. A and most countries in the Latin America speak it. It'll be useful for me to learn it."

They have just created this stupid accent that has nothing to do with any English native speaker's accent. Also, everyone is considering it the official accent. If anyone tries to speak more naturally, they will be considered cocky and just trying to show off. I really donÂ´t know who made these rules. I just want to speak English with someone who is capable of assessing my speaking ability. I donÂ´t want to enroll on any English classes, because mostly they will be a waste of time, just like the last 15 years. I want something more permanent and more reliable. I was thinking about attending some classes in the Faculty of Literature in the English Department. Sometimes, they have some discussions, so I thought it'd be a good place where I can have more fluid conversations, and might help me to think in English. But of course, I will not have much help with the accent. Now, since I took this decision, I have been trying to go there, but every time I intend to do so, something stops me. I really hate it when I'm enthusiastic about something and the circumstances forces me not to do it until I just cool off. Then, I just don't feel like doing this any more. Very frustrating! Any suggestions?"
Arabic,"Amazing Spray Painting It shocks me that some people can create the most beautiful views one can put their eyes on by a very little and simple strokes. In the video I posted here, not only that the painter usedÂ very basic tools, but also, he completed his charming picture only in one minute. I think creativity in that matter can't be learned, it's more like a gift one is born with. I'm not going to say much today because I don't have a lot of time. But I thought if I don't have the time to write, at least I should share with you something I like, and you might like, as well. Enjoy! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUgEe4V9o9c"
Arabic,"A question to Americans only There is a question which repeats most in my brain. I don't know why but i want to know its answer. This question has a relation with all American people only because some times i see most of them very genius and organized and priviledged in the same time. I didn't treat with American people before but i know a person who treated with them and he lived some years in America. He told me that the American people is differ than Egyption people in thier thinking, in their professional and personal life but not all people there. I write this entry beacuse i want American people to replay me face to face. How they think in thier peofessional and personal life and why all world say about them they are activity,lively and they are an advanced people. I also want to know how the noraml people spend thier normal day and thier vacation. In any country, people divide into layers. Every layer has its own life and its own think. I hope any one tell me about the life in each layer. Finally, I asked my best friend before i wrote this entry she told me that i'm sure that no one will replay to your question. i think that she is right because i'm sure that if i want to know the right answer to my questions, i must treat with American people. But I want you to replay me from your treatment with people and from your living there. thanks to any one will answer to me qestions."

Arabic,"Ramadan Hi! Tomorrow is the first day of Ramadan; which means that I mustn't eat or drink anything all day long, from the dawn till the sunset, and this everyday for a month. I remember the first time I had to do that, it was so difficult and I was so excited when I was allowed to eat!! Actually, it's an amazing month,I learn a lot from it, it makes me know how poor people feel when they are too hungry but can't eat anything even not a little bread, although it's very cheap!! Also, it helps me to control myself : I have food, I really want it, I need it and I'm able to take it but I don't, just because I mustn't and nothing else. So I wonder, if I can do that and other people too; that means that giving up smoking or drinking isn't impossible. What one needs to do so is some strength which could make him control his self and not the opposite. And then, he will feel free and strong enough to decide how to live."
Arabic,"simple difintion about Allah In Islam , there is one god he called Allah he is very strong so he don't need to any help he aslo merciful he created every thing and created us to worship him and if we do it he will give us happenese and heaven after death Allah sent a lot af messengers and prophet to tell the people about him like Ibraham , moses and Jesus The last prohet who sent was Mohmmad."
Arabic,"Restriction Last night I watched Inception. It was amazing. Then I opened my blog to write about it in English but I couldn't, cause sometimes I think English restricts me to express what I really feel. Being a student restricts me traveling a lot. Or restricts me doing many things I want to do. Now, using this word restrict is right or I made mistakes?"
Arabic,"Ramadan 1431 I was thinking Ramadan would start the 8th or the 9th of August, but I was wrong. In my country, it will start tomorrow the 12th . In some other countries, people have already started to fast from today. This is a sacred month in which we are appealed to fast. That means not only to abstain from eating and drinking, but also from commiting sins. Indeed, in Ramadan, we are particularly required to purify our souls and control our deeds and sayings ; which means to avoid bad ones and do heavily good ones. Because during this blessed month, the impact of every deed is amplified, whether it is good or bad. I spent today at cleaning home and I'm ready to welcome Ramadan! Ø±Ù…Ø¶Ø§Ù† ÙƒØ±ÙŠÙ…"

For example computers now itâ€™s very easy to type on the computers, but 50 or 60 years ago people were type by writing, and spend long time for writing.

Arabic,"Can women be leaders? One day, my colleagues and I made a debate about women with my insructor Sara Hassanein. During this debate Dr:Sara asked""Can women be leaders or not?"". Some of us said""Yes, women can be leaders.""while the others like me said""No, women can`t be leaders at all."". I am against that because women are not suitable for such a hard job not because they are weak but because they have a lot of tasks that are more important than being leaders such as raising the children up. I think that this the most important job for women specially nowadays. I think women have to think how to be leaders in home not in the country because there is abig difference between the woman who succeeded in leading her home and in raising her children up successfully and between who succeeded in leading a country but failed in leading her own house. In additions, women are not strong enough to bear the burdens of such a difficult job. We have to admitt that we are soft and easy to cry because we are more emotional than men. This my point of view and I am ready to defend it now it`s your turn to say whether women can be leaders or not but don`t forget to justify your point of veiw."
Arabic,"Learning Speaking English On Lang-8 By Audio Recording Audio recording is a feature that I found in other websites but didn't find it here. It really helped me a lot in correcting my pronunciation mistakes. When I found this feature in other websites, I used them more than lang-8, but at the end of the day, I'd come back here again. For some reason, I don't feel comfotable using any other websites. Maybe because this was the first website I used and it has been with me all the way through my learning process since I started. Anyway, I've seen some people using audio blogs, youtube or any other website to get their friends here listening to them and correcting their pronunciation. My friend, paperdoll, from Malaysia posted here an audio of herself reading an article. Since lang-8 isn't that interactive, those who want to improve their pronunciatoin can post their recording and native speakers can post the corrections in audio as well. Here is the website that my friend used: vocaroo. com. Messages recorded by logged-in users will expire after 6 months. Messages recorded anonymously and without an account will be deleted after 2 months. I guess thats enough to get correcections and responses on the pronunciation."
Arabic,terrorism a month ago there was an accident in egypt it happened that someone shot fire and there was an explosion . he exploded a church in alexandria and caused a death of some christians and muslims . We as muslims and christians felt very sorry about it. it's very souvage to wait until some people finish from their prayers and celebration and kill them in this cruel way. the person who was the cause of this problem does not have a relision at all. there is nothing in islam or christianity invites people to do this .

Arabic,"The X Factor Brings Tears & Laughter As my Lang-8 picture says, ""Life is not measured by the breaths we take... but by the moments that take our breath away"", I always try to find what would take my breath away. I assume that you already figured out where I look for these moments, YouTube. To me, YouTube is like the window that overlooks the whole world. There are so many talented people from all over the world that share some videos that make me laugh, cry or shocked. I consider all three reactions as good moments, even those that bring tears to my eyes. Crying in this case means you're feeling for someone who you barely know which reminds us of our humanity that might be forgotten sometimes in the rush of our busy lives. As always, I brought some videos but this time they're all from the X Factor. I think they are the best ones that I've seen of this show. I haven't seen much, though. The first video always makes me cry no matter how many times I watch it. The second one feels like drinking a cup of icy water in a very hot day.

Also, I played Sudoku, and I wrote this entry. :) --------- To be continued ----------------- ** In the pictures you can see my brother while he was driving, the things I spent my time by, and the cloudy weather that day. **"
Arabic,"Egypt Is Made In China I think it's not an exaggeration because if the components are made of something, then you can confidently and safely say that the whole is made of the same thing. Right? Everything around here is made in china from needles to cars. You name it. The question of ""where was it made?"" sounds very trivial coming from any Egyptian. I think ,soon, we should be expecting Egyptians labelled on the back of their neck: ""Made In China"". The problem is that the Chinese products are so bad, they always break down easily. Rumour has it that they export specific qualities to each country accordingly. I'm not sure I believe it but I'm not sure that I don't either."

Arabic,"Palestine tomorrow go will be free Where is happiness?, where is democracy?, where is freedom?and what happened to human rights?!!!. I need an immediat answers for my questions. I can not believe that happiness can be found in occupying the others, kill their children, and their women. Where is the beauty of the nature in Palestine, I can not see it due to the smoke of the bombs and the rockets which destroyed everything there. No life without peace which means that the palestenians can not live but they try to survive. The crops in Palestine can not grow because zoinists water them blood. Tombstones shout saying ""that`s enough"", mosques, churches, and temples say ""no more, religions did not say kill people, religions order us to love, respect each others, and live in peace"". We have to co-operate to seek for peace not to seek for destruction. The world let Israel occupy and kill the people in Palestine and if we try to defend them they call us terrorists, is it fair?. I am very sad not because of what happens in Palestine but because I feel as if I am handicapped and I can not do anything for them, but all I want now is to be there and defend this land by myself. Despite what happens there, I am not worried because I never have any doubt that Palestine tomorrow will be free."
Arabic,"Music Today, I'm in a mood for music! So, I choosed some different style of music, to introduce. First one, is from the south of Algeria. Well, it the music of Touareg. The land of Touareg extend to Mali, Nigeria and Lybia too. The Tergui music is very old and they use very ancient instruments, such as the Imzad. Imzad is an old instrument with one string! and it is reserved only for women! Although, nowaday, the Tergui music uses new instrument such as guitars. here you can see a famous Algerian Tergui singer Nabil Othmani (aka Nabil Othman Bali) with the American musician Steve Shehan. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_lrLaw2P5E Another group Tergui from Mali this time. The Touareg had lot of trouble in Mali, so they make some revolutions there in the 60s, 80s and early 90s. The group Tinariwen have members from Mali, but the leader lived most of his life in Algerian Touareg territory after his father was killed in Mali. The songs of the group are in most of them about freedom and revolutions. Here is one their songs that is about one of their battles: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRqiqHZhKOM Another style of music, from the east now. The Tunisian mezwed The instrument is the cousin of the bagpipe but it have a funny shape, you can guess what it's made of. ;) It's used also in Algeria, but here I'll show the Tunisian one. I think, though, the Tunisian music is close to the east Algerian music,the Tunisian one is more vibrant! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqvzZPc69LM the sound of the mezwed is different from the Scotish bagpipe, but yet, the Scotish and Celtic music is well employed in traditional Algerian music . Here is a specimen with a group called Mugar. The members are Algerian, Bretons and Scotish. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2Oi3ftSDfU&feature=related And among all instruments, the Gasba (the last picture)is the most important in all traditional music in Algeria :)"

Arabic,"Funny: A Loving Husband One day, a husband felt that his wife's hearing is getting weaker. He felt very scared about her losing her hearing. So, he went to consult a doctor about her problem. ""These problems have solutions. But to be more accurate about our diagnostics to her condition, I need you to run an experiment on her,"" said the doctor. ""Stand 40 feet away from your wife, and talk to her in a normal tune. If she didn't respond move closer to her to be 30 feet away and talk to her again. If she didn't respond move closer another 10 feet, and so forth."" The husband went home. He stood 40 feet away from his wife, and said to her in his normal tune, ""Honey, what do we have for dinner today?"" She didn't answer. So he moved forward 10 feet, and said, ""Honey, what do we have for dinner today?"" And again, she didn't say a word. He kept doing this until he was standing in front of her face to face. He said for the fifth time, ""Honey, what do we have for dinner today?"" ""Sweet hear, for the fifth time I tell you IT'S CHICKEN!"" the wife shouted. Do you get it? It's the husband who had been deaf all along, and not the wife. He just kept asking, not aware that his wife answered his question every single time he asked. While thinking that his wife didn't hear his question, he was the one who didn't hear her answer. So, why do one always tend to think that it's others who have something wrong with them but not oneself? Why is it so hard to believe that sometime it's one's fault, and that one should blame themselves for the mistake, and not anybody else. It seems like passing the blame is easier than facing the truth and taking responsibility for one's actions. If that's proves anything, then it proves that the strong one is the one who is able to take the blame for their own mistakes, admit them and face them. That's just my opinion."
Arabic,"New Information about Saudi Arabia == 2 == Some of my friends told me that they liked my entries. Especially, those about Arabic and Saudi cultures. I really thank them, and Iâ€™ve written this information about Saudi Arabia as one of the Arabic countries. I think that I havenâ€™t talked about this information before. I hope itâ€™ll be interesting. ** King Abdul Aziz AAL-Saud is the founder of the this country, he unified the whole regions as one country at 1932. ** Many universities, hospitals,â€¦etc. Are named after our kingsâ€™ names. If I take King Fahd as an example, there are King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, King Fahd International Airport, King Fahd Medical Complex, King Fahd Amusement parkâ€¦. etc. And in every city, there is a road called â€˜King Fahd Roadâ€™. The similar thing is with the other kingsâ€™ and princesâ€™ names. ** Most of the craft workers like plumbers, carpenters, electricians, builders,â€¦etc, also petrol attendants, nurses are foreigners. They are from: India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt, Yemen, Indonesia and Philippines. To be honest Saudis are spoiled, they want to work only in offices. Very few of Saudis work in craft works. ** All shops have to close at the time of each prayer (five times a day). And then open again after the prayer finishes (that takes about 15 minutes). When they do that, no acceptable reason will be for people not to pray at time. Shops won't make them busy from performing the prayers. ** The highest tower in Saudi Arabia is The Tower of Makkahâ€™s Clock. Its total high is 601 m, Itâ€™s located in Makkah, In front of the Holy Mosque. They havenâ€™t finished it yet, but they're working very fast. The second highest towers are Al-Mamlakah Tower (300 m) and Al-Faisaliah Tower ( 266 m). Both of them are in Riyadh(the capital). - First picture shows Makkah's Clock Tower. Notice the difference in high between the tower and the two minarets of the Holy Mosque( each one is 89 m). The second picture shows Al-Faisaliah Tower (the nearest one) and Al-Mamlakah Tower. - == To be continued ^^ =="
Arabic,"Translation Yesterday I was too bored so I went to a bookshop for a change. There, I found an Arabic novel for an author that I used to read his stories when I was at high school, so I thought I would buy it. The following is direct translation of the first few pages in that novel. Is the following English correct? ***** Salwa's pulse raised sharply as she was running through huge flat area, in a bizarre world. There was no place she could hide... There were only big mountains at the visible horizon, that had glittering green color, under bloody red sky. The land which she was running on was more flabby than the land she get used to at her world. A creepy creature appeared far away behind her, and started chasing her savagely and persistentï½Œï½™. A creature that she never saw in her world at all... She wished that this was just a dream Or even a nightmare Anything she could wake up from to find herself again in her real world, that she knew and got used to. Although it was strange world, it was real... A very creepy reality... The land started to quake under her feet... The more that that creature approached her, the more that the land was shaking... And Salwa stopped running! She did not know where she could go or hide, so she just stopped, and screamed: ""Nuur, where are you?"" She was wondering where her husband might have gone, as her screams echoed around, even though she was in a middle of huge empty space. Where did Nuur go? They were together when they were forced to come to this creepy world... They were together all the time, until that last battle... She lost him after that battle... She does not even know where he went, or how he disappeared And so, she is now alone, Doomed, And lost. The gigantic was still running towards her in incredibly fast speed... ****"

Arabic,"The last speaking assessment :D My English exam will be on Saturday. Itâ€™ll be the last time I take English, and I wonâ€™t study any English courses anymore. The speaking assessment will be on Sunday. From the beginning of this level they asked us to chose any issue to make a dialogue or role-play about it. Then we had to write the conversation weâ€™ll say and gave it to the teacher. So, weâ€™ll have enough time to practice and memorize our roles until the time of the assessment. I chose to make a dialogue about chocolate with one of my friends. Role-play seems to be a bit difficult. We have to act if we chose it, and Iâ€™m so bad in acting :S I wrote the scenario myself. Itâ€™s acceptable to get information from any source, but you have to write it with your own words. Iâ€™ve already gave the script to my teacher, but she said that she wonâ€™t focus much in grammar because speaking and pronouncing is more important. However, I want to know my mistakes in order to avoid them next time. After we finish the dialogue weâ€™ll give the teacher and the classmates chocolate. Here is the conversation, Iâ€™ll be girl B ^__^ I didnâ€™t make it long because they said that weâ€™ll take only 2-3 minutes. A- Hi! How are you? B- Pretty well. And you? A- Well. I bought this for you. B- Oo, thank you. Itâ€™s my favorite kind of chocolate. I mean I love all kinds, but this one has a special place in my heart. A- You know? Iâ€™ve read that eating chocolate calm and reduce worries and stress. B- Yeah, I always eat it when Iâ€™m angry or not in a good mood. It changes my mood immediately. Itâ€™s very useful in such these cases, believe me. A- So, you eat it a lot. Because as I know you are a moody person. And that isnâ€™t a good thing. Chocolate is full of fats and that may help in acne appearance. B- Ooo, donâ€™t worry. Iâ€™ve been eating it since Iâ€™ve known myself and nothing happened. Also, Iâ€™ve heard that the more chocolate you eat, the longer you live. A- How interesting! But why the wonder? It lowers the blood pressure. Especially, the dark one. Plus, It provides a lot of energy and makes people happy. Thatâ€™s why it may increase the personâ€™s age. B- I agree with you. However, you wonâ€™t believe the new information I read yesterday. It says that some animals, like dogs, canâ€™t eat chocolate. And if so, theyâ€™ll be sick. A- Woow, thatâ€™s new for me. I also knew that eating a large amount of it makes the breathing problems worse. B- hmm, but donâ€™t forget that it helps in reducing the wrinkles, and gives more beauty as the medical magazine said. Itâ€™s a convincing reason to not even think of stop eating it. Am I right? A- Surely, I canâ€™t imagine my life without chocolate. B- Me too. And I donâ€™t want to imagine such a terrifying thing like this. I donâ€™t know why, but each time I think of that day I feel nervous and worried. Iâ€™m confident with my pronunciation, and in the last assessment I got the full mark. Maybe Iâ€™m not confident with myself :â€™( I mean, standing in front of all classmates and talk always makes me nervous. Iâ€™ve tried to persuade myself that I can do it, itâ€™s easy, my English is better than some of them, so why Iâ€™m worried?!! But my attempts always fail, and I canâ€™t stop those frustrating feelings. Pleaaaase friends, pray for me (crying face)"
Arabic,"Dignity I have all my dignity. So, I'm Okay. My dignity is as important as my life. My favorite animal is the horse. Do you know why? It's because when looking at it, I don't feel I'm looking to an animal,I rather feel I'm dealing with a noble being. While being in trouble, I usually look at the sky to destress myself. I feel then the greatness of being high. I know that everything will come to an end, but the sky will still be there, very high, as usual. So I calm down and deal with things without losing a bit of my dignity."

Arabic,"Hablantes De InglÃ©s, Teneis Mucha Suerte! Envidio los hablantes de inglÃ©s porque hay muchas similitudes entre espaÃ±ol e inglÃ©s. Realmente, creo que hay muy pequeÃ±as diferencias entre los dos. Muchas palabras del espaÃ±ol son prestadas de inglÃ©s. Los hablantes de inglÃ©s pueden entender la idea general de un artÃ­culo fÃ¡cilmente incluso si sabÃ­an nada de espaÃ±ol. Ellos no tienen que memorizar muchas palabras nuevas. El Ãºnico problema que encuentran con estudiar espaÃ±ol es la pronunciaciÃ³n. SÃ³lo dos diferencias que pordÃ­a notar entre la pronunciaciÃ³n del inglÃ©s y del espaÃ±ol. Ellas son la Â¨rÂ¨ y la Â¨lÂ¨. La Â¨rÂ¨ es mÃ¡s fuerte en espaÃ±ol que en inglÃ©s. Pero, la Â¨lÂ¨ es mÃ¡s mimada en inglÃ©s que en espaÃ±ol. Eso es sÃ³lo mi opiniÃ³n."

Arabic,"I, too, criticize America. Since I was young, I used to hear that America is one of the most important countries that calls for democracy, and respecting human rights. Regardless its progress, I hope my country will be a real democratic one. But after the death of Benladen, I began to ask myself""is that the way bywhich America respects the dignity of human beings?"". The way America used to kill Benladen doesn`t reflect the democratic face of America. I can`t deny what Benladen did, I can`t deny that he was the main cause of the explosion of the two towers in America. But I am not talking about the terrorist Benladen as you him, I am talking about the human Benladen. I am not defending him but if America sees that Benladec is a criminal and he must die, I think she should have arrested him and made a fair trail to him. This way reflecs an indemocratic face of America. Oh, America if you call for respecting human rights and human dignity, why you threw Benladen`s cropse in the sea asif he was an animal not a human being. I know that a lot of American people were killed but whatever he did, one of his rights as a dead body was to be buried, one of his rights was to have a tomb. I am totally against what America did as I were totally what he himself did. I want to tell America if you are a preacher, do as you preach otherwise you will be seen as hypocrite not a democratic country. Take care of what you are saying and what you are doing, and don`t contradict yourself. Respect human rights, be democratic, and don`t forget that you are America."
Arabic,"Nostalgia--I want to know please if this essay can express the feeling of home sickness and the obstacles that person can face in the forgeon countries? sometimes adapting to a new country can not be so easy dor some people; however, some can harmonize with the diffuculties of living alone away from their parents. for me, I was very interested to move to live alone but later I was stunned by the reality after one week when I saw that everything: script of the life, food, friend and even the water were very different from my home country. At first I hadn't thought of any obstacles that I may face when I be alone; however, it wasn't only me feel this way in the same way my friends that they had lived in these forgeon countries. as soon as I realized where I am, I became more homesick to my hometown, to the beautiful places, my room, my friends and even to my mothers's hug. Since I started to think of how lively beautiful places my country has , in the contrary, to the old old, bad, dirty country that I live now, I couldn't stand of being away that long from my country. Ever since I had thought of anything to do I felt nostalgia to my previos life. Coming to an end; when I had already decided to leave, I felt very comfortable because I will go back to the place I had born from in this way couldn't face the obstacles but the obstacle faced me."

We were on the summer vacation, so many people go to this city, because of its cool weather. So, we drove from hotel to another,but the result is same,no place!! My brother-who was drove our car- was so angry, and my uncles too. All streets were crowded. When it was around 11 p. m we finally found a too small apartment. That means we spent four hours searching for a place to stay at!! All of us were tired, so we slept quickly. In the next afternoon, we went to a a park,we sat there and ate our lunch. Then we went back to Jeddah at 4 p.m. Nobody wanted to stay at that apartment in that crowded city. I really didn't enjoy this trip,it was weired. :("

Arabic,"health My assigment is about health, I choose this topic because it is very important for our life and we have to learn about it, why it is very imoprtant? Because health it is the body energy if some one in bad health he will live in bad life because health is the life, no health no life. They are three majors things to be in good health, the first thing is healthly lifestyles,the second thing is healthy diet and the thiered thing is daily exercise. How can we be in healthy lifestyles?Most of people ask this quistionand things, the first thing is sleep early and get up early because huomen body be more relaxing in this way,the second thing is stop drinking alcohol and smoking because it is very bad for the health if some drinking or somking he will die very early, the thiered thing is doing medical test evrey six months to check the health, if all people doing all this three majors things they will be in healthy lifestyles. And all of this things is very important because it help the people to be in good health. Healthy diet is very important to keep us in healthy lifestayles because it is help us from the obsity. In healthy dite we should eat plenty of fresh fruit and raw vegetables ,((wich are full of vitamins and minerals)),plant of fibre for healthy digestion and cheese, agges, fish. In healthy diet you should not eat fast food , pizza , cackes and any thing fried because it has a lot of calories . Daily exercise is very important for our health because it gives us energy. What is exercise? ((exercise is some activity like walking , swimming, yogaand all of sport)). The fames exercise in the first world countries is the walking because we can do it any where, all the exercise are very good for health. Finly I would like to say we have to take care of our health because health is evrey thing in the life, keep healthy , eat healthy to live healthy ."

Arabic,"2 months with kids I'm an intern doctor and I'm doing a 2 month pediatric shift as part of my internship program. The shift has been exciting so far but dealing with children is not an easy task if you want my opinion. I love kids, I thought it was a fact but now I realized it needed modification. Yes, I do love them ( the chubby cheeks, cute giggles and pure innocence, etc) as long as they are not crying their lungs out! Many children are afraid of doctors, may be because of previous bad experience or may be just because of the overwhelming atmosphere of white coats, strange instruments and patients all over. Any how, in almost all the young kids, once you approach them and start examining them they start crying, screaming and wobbling and rolling in all possible directions, no matter how nice you are, they come with a dogma, doctors are evil! And mothers sometimes make it worse, by threatening the kids with words like ""if you don't stop screaming the doctor will give you an injection"" which stimulates all the crying and horror powers inside the kid, obviously! I imagine that in kids world, doctors are notorious creatures, imagine a child setting with his peers telling them about his horrible experience yesterday at a clinic when the evil doctor was trying to listen to his chest with a dreadful stethoscope! There is more about dealing with children but I think I'll leave it for another post."

Arabic,"Changing To Exams Mode I'm supposed to be ready for these exams in a week. I'm still having trouble with memorizing my professor's names (no kidding), let along what they are teaching. They shower us with assignments that we don't have enough time to eat, sleep or study, so we have to do so during lectures :). Just kidding! Of course we can't eat during lectures but some professors urge us to sleep, this is something I find very hard to resist sometimes. Their regular and constant tone makes me feel like I'm hypnotized after 5 minutes from the beginning of the lecture which is something I can do nothing about especially if I didn't sleep well the night before. I really miss my lang-8 family. I also wish if I could spend more time on Spanish and writing journal entries in both English and Spanish, but there is always something in the way. I would like to apologize if I reply to messages or comments a bit late, that would be because I don't have the time to do so and even if I had some time, it would be only enough to sneak and read them. I'm doing my best to keep in touch with the lang-8 world but I might fail to do so during the week of exams."

It was more like rocks. It's sound when it hit the ground was like a rock (like the ice you put i your juice) dropping from the tenth floor. The streets were pretty empty that day except from a few number of people who didn't see this rock shower coming. Who would have?

Arabic,"It keeps getting worse! My exams started 2 weeks ago. At first, we felt very optimistic as the first exam was pretty easy and no one had any complaints about it. I thought that was a good sign... but time proved me wrong. The second exams was in Statistics. We had a previous warning that the exams that our professor make are very very tall. I thought may be it's tall but not impossible to finish in two hours. I was completely wrong about that, It was impossible to finish in two hours. Things went really bad, I mean really aweful. When the observer was saying that half the time has passed, I was in the second question and the whole exam consisted of 8 questions ... so I started to feak out. Anyway, this exam went better than the next one. The next one would be Data and Computer Communications. When I first got the test papers I kept looking for something that I'd be familiar with but all in vain. And here comes the third exam which was the worst, Decision Support. I started with the first question was very ambigious. I left it and started to read the next one, I kept doing this till I found that I'm reading the last question. This was really shocking because I'm not used to this feeling of not passing an exam. I always find my way out but this was a horrible experience that I hope never to encounter again. There are 2 exams left before I get my freedom but the signs aren't indicating to any good news about these exams. I'm trying to save the last drop of optimism that I have but those exams aren't helping at all."

Arabic,"The Smartest Horse Ever A farmer's horse fell in a deep, dry well. The animal cried out of pain and the severe impact of falling. The moaning continued for several hours. During this time, the farmer was thinking about how to save his horse. But,Â it didn't take him too long to convince himself that the horse is so old, and that saving the horse would cost him as much as buying a new one. Besides, the well had been dry for long time and it needed to be bridged. Thus, he called his neighbours and asked them to help him in bridging the well so he would solve two problems at the same time (bridging the well and burying the horse). Everyone picked a shovel and started throwing garbage and dust into the well. The horse realized what was going on so it kept whinnying as a request for mercy and help. After a little while, there was a silence, and every one was surprised. However, they threw a little bit more of dust, then the farmer looked inside the well, and saw the most shocking scene. He saw the horse shaking his back to throw the dust thrown on it to the ground, then tookÂ one step up, and so forth. As they threw more dust, the horse approached more to the surface. At last the horse was so close to the surface that a simple leap enabled him to get to the surface smoothly and easily. Similarly, life throws a lot of pain and troubles on one's back; all what they need to do to overcome them, is simply to do the same as the horse did. Every trouble we face is a stumbling block on the road of our lives. So no need to worry, we have just learned how to survive from the deepest well of troubles, by simply sweeping those troubles of your back and move one step up. So throw the abuses and conspiracies that you met through your life under your feet and step on them. Let them lift you up. The horse teaches us the main five rules of happiness: 1) Empty your heart from hatred. 2) Empty your mind from concern. 3) Try to live a simple life. 4) Give, give and never stop giving. 5) Expect to gain a little."

Arabic,socer games Soccer games My favourite hobby is playing soccer and watching soccer match as well Iâ€™m really mad about real Madrid I love to watch all real Madrid matchâ€™s but now I canâ€™t watch all of them because the time is different here to Europe .

In my opinion I think that soccer is very interesting game and itâ€™s very interested game in my country Iâ€™d really like to go to one of real Madrid gameâ€™s real Madrid is one of the most popular teams in the world. The reason that I canâ€™t go to football matches that itâ€™s very expensive to buy the ticket and I must buy it before one month at least. There are people spend a lot of money to go over seas to see the match of there team.

It's only for girls, and who wants to join them has to be one of the university's students. Last year my older sister thought that she could make some small gifts boxes and cards. So, she joined them and started to work hard in order to make as much crafts as she could before the time of bazaar. Her idea was to make gifts boxes and cards by colored papers. She made different shapes, even shapes of some popular football teams' t-shirts. :D First, she made few samples and showed them to the responsible. She liked them but gave her some advice to make them better. So, as she followed the responsible's advice, my sister's crafts became more attractive. I'm embarrassed due to not helping her. But honestly, I don't like making handmade crafts. I'm too lazy to make or even think of making them. :S Two days before the bazaar, my cousin and I helped my sister in arranging her corner. We spent an interesting time, working, taking a rest and eating, then working again. ^^ Because there were many participants, each of them had small corner. The bazaar was for three days, and the invitation was general not only for universityâ€™s students . In the first day (the opening day), a Princess (one of our kingâ€™s daughters)attended to open the bazaar. I attended twice, one with my friends, and the other with mom and my youngest sister. At the second time I helped my sister in selling her crafts . She sold fine quantity. So, she felt satisfied. Some of the visitors asked her if she could make large quantity in case they need it for some occasions. But she apologized, because she works individual and that might be too much for her. About the bazaar, it was very crowded. The most crowded corner was that selling very beautiful Japanese things(mugs, pillows, bags, medals,â€¦etc.) with Japanese drawings and writings in them. They also sold Sochi. There were variety of handmade crafts(perfume, medals, some homeâ€™s essentials, paintings, clothes,â€¦etc.). I donâ€™t forget to mention fast food, sweets, and drinks. I really didnâ€™t buy anything. :( I found some attractive crafts, but their prices were extremely over. I thought logically that I can find things similar to them in another places with suitable prices. I just drank Coffee Latte, it was my first time to try it. :D The organizer made a vote to which corner is the best. And at the last day, they made a party only for the participants. Now, mom asks me to be like my sister and try to make some crafts in order to participate in that bazaar. :S I really donâ€™t think in doing that. >< Mom also like making handmade crafts, she already has made some to decorate our home. ^^ ### The first and second pictures shows the gifts boxes and the cards. The third one shows one of mom's handmade crafts. ###"

Arabic,"Smart Kid Once a little boy went to a barber shop. The barber whispered to one of his customers, ""This kid is the stupidest one you can ever see. Just wait, and I'll prove it to you."" He put a dollar in one hand and 25 cents in the other. Then he called the boy and asked him to take one of them. The boy took the 25 cents and went out. ""What did I tell you? He never learns! He always makes the same choice,"" the barber said to the customer, with a grin on his face. When the customer went out of the barber shop, he saw the kid going out of an ice cream shop. He wanted to ask him about the reason of choosing the 25 cents over the dollar. So, he stopped the boy and asked him. I don't choose the dollar, because the day I take it, the game will be over,""the boy replied, then he went on with his way. The point is, some people think that others are stupid, so they don't deserve respect, while the truth is that the stupidest thing that one can do is thinking that they are smarter than everyone else. I really hate when people do that, because having a quiet conversation with them would be impossible, when their noses are up in the sky. It seems like the word ""Humility"" doesn't exist in their dictionary. Being around these people is really annoying, especially, when they try to show off. Like this friend I had who always tried to show me that she could be better than me. Sometimes, she lied so as to look good in front of me, though I always know when she was lying. When I asked her if she understood a specific lesson or not, she always said, ""Yes of course, it was very easy,"" although I'm sure that it wasn't easy at all. Plus, the one she claimed to be easy had a connection to some previous concepts and terminologies that she had never heard before, because she never attended any of the classes they were explained in. So, I found it very hard to believe her. But, what can I do? She never seems to change at all. Actually, I'm sick of trying to make her understand that the greatest sacrifices aren't those who make people think good of you but the ones who makes you think good of yourself. But, she just wouldn't listen. It's weird how this entry evolved to end up with me talking about my friend."
Arabic,"Way of our thinking Society, sometimes, restraints our thinking and tries to direct us in limited way . All ideas, almost, which we have adopted taken from our parents, relatives, friends and teachers. We took these ideas as a postulate without discussion, just applied it and follow up it. I think this is a normal thing in beginning of life because a child can't distinguish between wrong and right, so he must imitate the society. The problem comes when we become elder and still our way of thinking like children: taken all ideas that around us and accept it without evaluation. If we do that, then that means we don't respect ourselves and still living in childish stage. The best gift that has been given to us is our brain which make us differ from other creatures with our ability to think, concept and percept. So we have to apply this gift and don't let others people control it. We should have a correct criteria that gives us a faculty to judge on things. I know we can't emancipate from effects our society but we can built our world that its foundation came from our persuasions. But in the horizontal appear a important question; how can we get our criteria?"

He was treated by his buddies as a serf with no caring about his feelings. they abuse treating him by insulting him with his mom. Ultimately,His daughter was in a trouble -after leaving her- She don't know how can she live on earth without her dad, mom and brother. She feels that no body was caring her and no body loves her so, She comes to me and spend for more than one month with me in my apartment knowing that according to my country's code of ethics it was prohibited and that is make the trouble exceeds when her father knows that she was in my flat, he fights me and makes me feel that I am guilty because I offer his daughter the secure that she lacks with him.

Arabic,"Angelina Julie & Emily Browning All the time, people tell me that I make some weird analogies. I can't help it. Whenever I see something, I immediately connect it to another thing I've seen before. For example, yesterday I was watching a movie called ""Lemony Snickets"" starring Jim Carrey. And there was also a little actress in the movie -- called Emily Browning -- that kept reminding me of Angelina Julie. At first I thought that this girl is Angelina Julie (when she was little), but then I thought, the difference between Angelina and Jim can't be that big. I have attached a picture of both of them. They seem so much alike. What's driving me crazy is that no one admits that they look alike. None of my friends seem to notice any of the analogies that I make, although I believe they are crystal clear. So, what do you think? Do they look alike or not?"
Arabic,"televisions Televisions!How can we live without them. They are considered as the most important thigs we should have in our homes. It is at every home. They keep us updated with the world . They are suitable for any age because of them variety of programes. They help to combine all the family together . Televisions also have many of advantages and disadvantages. In recent years, televisions have improved greatly. They have a lot of different kinds of models and sizes. They also show a lot of different programes for children,young people and elders. But somtimes they show bad programes and that they are not good for us. Even with those bad programes we still watch them. Most of the people spend a lot of time watching them and that are not good for their healthy. However, they make us feel very happy. they also help us to exchange information and again knowledge which were not available before. They make us very comfortable. I thing Televisions are the best inventions (or invention?) in the history of the world . They have changed a lot of our habits. We can't live one day without watching it. They help us to overcome our depressions. They make us feel very glad and comfortable."

Arabic,"friendship Why do we looking for make friendship? Do we really need friends to make our life more comfortable? Does a friend bring a happiness into our life? And before we talking about the friendship, what is the meaning of the friendship? When I say for someone, he is my friend? Actually, the life without friends, its likes a tree without leaves. But how can we get a good friend in this material world which put its benefit above any thing. Good luck."
Arabic,"A Lecture Or A Torture Yesterday, I had this torture -- I mean lecture -- that lasted for one and a half hour. The reason why I'm calling it torture, because the professor who was giving it is about to cause me brain damage. I'm not used to whine about things , but this one pushed me to the line. I call him professor Okay, because he seems not capable of completing one sentence without using the word okay 2 or 3 times. So, a 10 second of his lecture would be like this: ""Today, OKAY, we're going to talk about signals, OKAY. The signals are transmitted, OKAY, and it travels until it gets to the receiver, OKAY. The the receiver, OKAY, receives signals, OKAY. And try to translate it, OKAY, into an understandable data, OKAY..."" Actually, I think he uses more 3 or 4 okays in these 10 seconds, but you got the idea, Right? Note: he uses an Arabic word ""ØªÙ…Ø§Ù…"", but I think okay is almost the same meaning. So, I might be overreacting, but I really can't stand repetition of a single pattern for too long. It just gets on my nerves. I always get mad if someone said something more than two times. This professor literally repeats the word Okay over hundred times in his hour and a half lecture, so I think I'm loosing it. I don't know how to deal with this. Of course, I can't tell him to stop saying it, because that would be very embarrassing and inappropriate thing to say to a professor, in the same time, I can't attend his lectures like that. The weird thing is that some of my friends didn't notice it at all, while I noticed it from the first two minutes of his first lecture. It's really not that hard to tell that he is obsessed with this word. And even the ones who noticed didn't seem to have much problem with it. After the first lecture, I kept asking students if they noticed it, I was just making sure that I'm not imagining it or something like that, because it seemed very abnormal to me. I mean, can't he notice that? Doesn't he get bored of saying this word over and over again? I heard that in some prisons they torture prisoners by dropping a consecutive drops of water on prisoners' head in a steady pattern for hours. Finally, those prisoners go mad. That's exactly what I'm feeling about this lecture. I just hope that I don't loose my mind by the end of the semester."

Arabic,"A step forward I decided to take the next step and start learning English in a language's school. I always teach my self the English, not with books or audio tapes or any other method, it was just by necessity; I like movies, music and game video, as they mostly in English, somehow I get used to it, of course I learned the basics at school, but most people forget about it after the high school since we use French as a second language not English. But now I need to master English for professional reason, and my method is not enough any more. So I went to a language's school, and take a test to define my level, and it was level seven; there is twelve levels, which mean I'm five level away from mastering English (I'll start from level eight). Any way the teacher asked me where I did learn English before, and I answered: from high school and I kept practicing it by watching American movies and I use Internet a lot! I didn't wanted to tell her that I learned most of the English words from playing video games, I'm too old to confess that I still play ;)"
